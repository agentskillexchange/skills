# Playwright Test Generator with Codegen

The Playwright Test Generator leverages Playwright Codegen to record user interactions and produce maintainable end-to-end test scripts. Recording sessions capture clicks, form fills, navigation, and assertions across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers simultaneously through Playwright multi-browser architecture.
Generated tests use the Playwright Test runner with TypeScript for type-safe selectors, built-in auto-waiting, and web-first assertions that eliminate flaky test patterns. The Page Object Model pattern is applied to generated code with automatic selector optimization preferring test-id attributes, ARIA roles, and text content over brittle CSS selectors.
Visual regression testing integrates through the playwright-visual-regression plugin with configurable diff thresholds, platform-specific baselines, and automatic screenshot management. Test results flow to Allure reporting framework producing rich HTML reports with step-by-step traces, screenshots, and video recordings attached to failed tests. The generator supports API mocking via Playwright route interception for isolated frontend testing, and network HAR recording for replay-based test stabilization. Parallel execution leverages Playwright sharding for CI environments with automatic retry configuration for infrastructure-related failures.

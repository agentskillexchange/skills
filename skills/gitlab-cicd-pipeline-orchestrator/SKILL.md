# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator

The GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Orchestrator skill manages complex deployment pipelines through .gitlab-ci.yml configuration and the GitLab REST API v4. It generates pipeline configurations using GitLab CI concepts including stages, jobs with rules/only/except conditions, extends keyword for job inheritance, and include for multi-file pipeline composition (include:local, include:remote, include:template). The skill leverages the GitLab API endpoints (projects/{id}/pipelines, projects/{id}/jobs, projects/{id}/trigger/pipeline) for triggering pipelines with variables, monitoring job status, downloading artifacts, and managing environments. Advanced features include DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) scheduling with needs keyword for parallel job optimization, multi-project pipeline triggers using trigger: keyword, parent-child pipelines for dynamic configuration, and review environments with auto-stop. The orchestrator handles GitLab Runner configuration (config.toml) for Docker and Kubernetes executors, manages CI/CD variables at project/group levels via the API, and supports compliance pipeline enforcement through group-level includes.

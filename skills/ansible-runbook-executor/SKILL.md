# Ansible Runbook Executor

The Ansible Runbook Executor agent leverages the ansible-runner Python SDK to execute diagnostic and remediation playbooks on remote infrastructure. It parses YAML-based inventory files, resolves host groups, and manages vault-encrypted secrets for secure credential handling during execution.
Designed for incident response, the agent can run pre-defined runbooks for common scenarios: disk space cleanup, service restarts, log collection, certificate rotation, and DNS resolution checks. Each playbook execution produces structured JSON output with per-host task results, return codes, and stdout/stderr capture.
The agent streams real-time task output via ansible-runner event handlers, enabling live progress tracking during long-running operations. It supports check mode (dry-run) for validation before applying changes, and integrates with Ansible Galaxy for pulling community roles. Tags and limits can be applied dynamically to scope execution to specific hosts or task subsets.

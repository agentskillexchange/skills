title: "Parquet Schema Extractor for S3"
description: "This skill uses boto3 to list objects in an S3 prefix and downloads Parquet file footers using range requests (GetObject with Range header) to avoid full file downloads. PyArrow is used to parse the Parquet metadata footer and extract the schema including field names, data types, and nullable flags. The skill compares schemas across partition directories by hashing schema fingerprints and flagging deviations. Type compatibility checks follow Arrow type promotion rules to identify breaking changes (e.g., INT32 to STRING conversions). Schema history is optionally stored in an AWS DynamoDB table for drift tracking across daily pipeline runs. Output includes a Markdown schema diff report with the exact partition paths containing incompatible schemas and recommended schema evolution strategies for Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake tables."

The skill compares schemas across partition directories by hashing schema fingerprints and flagging deviations. Type compatibility checks follow Arrow type promotion rules to identify breaking changes (e.g., INT32 to STRING conversions). Schema history is optionally stored in an AWS DynamoDB table for drift tracking across daily pipeline runs. Output includes a Markdown schema diff report with the exact partition paths containing incompatible schemas and recommended schema evolution strategies for Apache Iceberg or Delta Lake tables.

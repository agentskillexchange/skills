# Grafana Unified Alerting Manager

The Grafana Unified Alerting Manager skill provides full lifecycle management of alerting configurations across Grafana instances using the Grafana Alerting HTTP API. It creates and updates alert rules with PromQL, LogQL, or SQL expressions, configures contact points for email, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhook receivers, and manages notification policies with label-based routing trees. The skill supports alert rule provisioning via the Provisioning API for GitOps workflows, silence creation and expiry management, and mute timing configurations for maintenance windows. Features include bulk rule import/export in JSON and YAML formats, alert rule testing with sample data evaluation, and cross-instance rule synchronization for high-availability Grafana deployments. Integrates with Grafana OnCall API for escalation chain management.

# PagerDuty Event Orchestration Runbook

PagerDuty Event Orchestration Runbook is for teams that want their agents to react to production incidents in a disciplined way instead of improvising from alert to alert. It works with real PagerDuty surfaces such as the Events API v2, Event Orchestration routing rules, the Incidents API, and Response Plays. That combination makes it practical for translating raw telemetry into routed incidents, attaching the right urgency, and kicking off the same follow-up steps every time a known failure pattern appears.


The skill is especially useful when alerts arrive from multiple systems with inconsistent payloads. It can normalize source data, map events to service-specific escalation paths, and check whether a responder workflow should page immediately or just create a lower-noise incident with enrichment. Because Response Plays and incident actions are part of the workflow, the runbook can also standardize stakeholder notifications, remediation notes, and links to relevant dashboards or logs.


Use this skill when you need reproducible incident handling for on-call teams, cleaner escalation logic, and fewer judgment calls in the first minutes of an operational event.

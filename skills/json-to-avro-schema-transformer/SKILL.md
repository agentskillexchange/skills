# JSON-to-Avro Schema Transformer

This skill accepts a JSON Schema document and converts it to an Apache Avro schema using custom mapping logic built on the jsonschema library for validation and fastavro for Avro serialization. It resolves $ref references recursively and maps JSON Schema types to Avro equivalents (string, int, long, float, boolean, null, array, record). Optional fields in JSON Schema (those not in required) are converted to Avro union types with null. The transformed Avro schema is validated by fastavro.parse_schema before registration. The skill then calls the Confluent Schema Registry REST API (POST /subjects/{subject}/versions) to register the schema under a configurable subject naming strategy (TopicNameStrategy or RecordNameStrategy). Dry-run mode outputs the Avro JSON without registration. Useful for migrating REST API payloads to Kafka event streams.

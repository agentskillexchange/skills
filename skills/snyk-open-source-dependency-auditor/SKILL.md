title: "Snyk Open Source Dependency Auditor"
description: "The Snyk Open Source Dependency Auditor uses the Snyk CLI test command and Snyk REST API to perform comprehensive software composition analysis across project dependency trees. It resolves full transitive dependency graphs for npm (package-lock.json), Python (Pipfile.lock, requirements.txt), Go (go.sum), and Maven (pom.xml) projects. Each vulnerability is matched against the Snyk Vulnerability Database with enriched context including exploit maturity, social trending, and reachability analysis that determines if vulnerable code paths are actually invoked. The skill generates automated fix recommendations—either version upgrades to patched releases or Snyk-maintained patches for cases where upgrades would cause breaking changes. It can create GitHub pull requests with precise version bumps, updated lock files, and detailed changelogs explaining what each upgrade addresses. License compliance checking identifies AGPL, GPL, and other copyleft dependencies that may conflict with commercial software distribution."

The Snyk Open Source Dependency Auditor uses the Snyk CLI test command and Snyk REST API to perform comprehensive software composition analysis across project dependency trees.

Each vulnerability is matched against the Snyk Vulnerability Database with enriched context including exploit maturity, social trending, and reachability analysis that determines if vulnerable code paths are actually invoked. The skill generates automated fix recommendations—either version upgrades to patched releases or Snyk-maintained patches for cases where upgrades would cause breaking changes. It can create GitHub pull requests with precise version bumps, updated lock files, and detailed changelogs explaining what each upgrade addresses. License compliance checking identifies AGPL, GPL, and other copyleft dependencies that may conflict with commercial software distribution.

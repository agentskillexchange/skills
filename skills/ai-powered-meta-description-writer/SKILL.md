Each generated description includes the primary target keyword within the first 70 characters, a clear value proposition, and a call-to-action phrase. Google SERP Preview validation checks pixel width rendering using a canvas measureText approximation to ensure descriptions display without truncation on desktop and mobile. The skill processes pages in batches of 50, using wp_remote_post() for OpenAI API calls with configurable temperature settings.

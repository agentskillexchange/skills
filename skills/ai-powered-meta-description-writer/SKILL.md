# AI-Powered Meta Description Writer

This skill automates meta description generation for large-scale websites using the OpenAI Chat Completions API with gpt-4o-mini for cost efficiency. It fetches existing page content through the WordPress REST API, extracts key themes using TF-IDF scoring, and generates compelling meta descriptions within the 155-character SERP display limit. The agent integrates directly with Yoast SEO plugin REST fields (yoast_head_json.description) for seamless WordPress updates. Each generated description includes the primary target keyword within the first 70 characters, a clear value proposition, and a call-to-action phrase. Google SERP Preview validation checks pixel width rendering using a canvas measureText approximation to ensure descriptions display without truncation on desktop and mobile. The skill processes pages in batches of 50, using wp_remote_post() for OpenAI API calls with configurable temperature settings. A/B testing support generates multiple variants per page with confidence interval tracking. Performance tracking integrates with Google Search Console API to measure CTR changes post-update.

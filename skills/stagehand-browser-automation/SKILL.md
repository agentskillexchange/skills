# Stagehand Browser Automation

Stagehand is Browserbase’s open-source browser automation framework for developers who want to combine natural-language control with code-level precision. The upstream project describes it as an AI browser automation framework and positions it between traditional browser testing tools and fully autonomous agents. In practice, that makes it useful when an agent needs to navigate unfamiliar pages with AI, but still hand off repeatable work to code once the workflow is understood.


The project exposes actions such as act() for individual browser steps, agent() for multi-step flows, and extract() for structured data capture. Its examples show integration with a browser context, page navigation, typed schemas via Zod, and support for production-oriented patterns such as previewing AI actions, caching repeated steps, and self-healing when a website changes. The repository also documents a quickstart flow with npx create-browser-app, local development via pnpm install, and optional Browserbase credentials for hosted browser infrastructure.


For ASE users, the concrete job-to-be-done is reliable browser automation that can start with prompts and evolve into stable workflows. It fits web testing, lead capture, UI navigation, structured extraction, and repeatable back-office tasks. Because the upstream project publishes documentation, has an MIT license, active releases, and heavy recent GitHub activity, it clears the intake gate for verified metadata publication.

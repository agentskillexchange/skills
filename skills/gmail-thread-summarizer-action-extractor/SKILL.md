# Gmail Thread Summarizer and Action Extractor

Fetches Gmail threads via the Gmail API (users.threads.get), extracts full message content, and produces a structured summary with action items, decisions, and follow-ups. Uses MIME part decoding for multi-part HTML/plain text emails and handles forwarded thread chains.

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.

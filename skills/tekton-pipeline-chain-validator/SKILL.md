# Tekton Pipeline Chain Validator

The Tekton Pipeline Chain Validator skill enforces supply chain integrity for Tekton CI/CD pipelines running on Kubernetes. It queries the Tekton Results API to retrieve completed pipeline runs and validates each task image reference against Sigstore cosign signatures. The skill verifies SLSA provenance attestations using in-toto format, checking builder identity, source repository, and build configuration against policy constraints. It supports Tekton Chains integration by validating that TaskRun results include proper signed attestations in the transparency log. Can enforce policies requiring specific signature thresholds, keyless signing via Fulcio certificates, and Rekor log inclusion. Generates compliance reports in SARIF format compatible with GitHub Code Scanning. Alerts on unsigned images, expired certificates, or provenance gaps via PagerDuty or OpsGenie webhooks.

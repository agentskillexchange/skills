The Ansible Playbook Diagnostics Runner skill executes diagnostic playbooks using ansible-runner (ansible_runner.run()) and the Ansible automation framework. It leverages modules from ansible.builtin (command, shell, copy, template, service, systemd) and community.general (ufw, nmcli, sysctl, modprobe) collections to perform comprehensive system diagnostics.
The skill manages inventory through dynamic inventory plugins (aws_ec2, azure_rm, gcp_compute) and static YAML/INI inventory files. It executes health check playbooks that gather facts using ansible.builtin.setup, check service status with ansible.builtin.systemd, analyze disk usage via ansible.builtin.command (df, du), and collect log entries using ansible.builtin.shell with journalctl queries.
Advanced capabilities include role-based diagnostic suites organized as Ansible roles with tasks/handlers/defaults/vars, callback plugin integration for custom output formatting (json, yaml, timer), vault-encrypted variable management for sensitive credentials, and async task execution for long-running diagnostics with poll intervals. The runner also supports check mode (–check) for dry-run validation, diff mode (–diff) for configuration drift detection, and custom filter plugins for log parsing and metric extraction.

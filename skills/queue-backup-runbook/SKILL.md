# Queue Backup Runbook

Queue Backup Runbook is built around Apache Kafka event streaming platform. The underlying ecosystem is represented by tulios/kafkajs (3,987+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like topics, partitions, consumer groups, offsets, producers, admin APIs and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.

In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to kafka so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The implementation typically relies on topics, partitions, consumer groups, offsets, producers, admin APIs, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

Accesses topics, partitions, consumer groups, offsets, producers, admin APIs instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.
Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.
Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.
Fits into broader integration points such as queue backlogs, stream processing, event-driven pipelines, and DLQ handling.

As a runbook-style skill, the value is not just tool access but operational sequencing: check the right signals first, reduce alert noise, and produce a summary that another engineer can act on immediately. Key integration points include queue backlogs, stream processing, event-driven pipelines, and DLQ handling. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

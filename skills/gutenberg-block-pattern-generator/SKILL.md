# Gutenberg Block Pattern Generator

The Gutenberg Block Pattern Generator automates the creation of custom block patterns for the WordPress editor. Using register_block_pattern() and register_block_pattern_category(), it builds organized libraries of reusable content layouts. The agent parses existing page designs and converts them into block markup using the @wordpress/blocks package serialize() function. It supports InnerBlocks configurations, dynamic blocks with ServerSideRender, and pattern transformations via the @wordpress/block-editor useBlockProps hook. The generator validates all patterns against the WordPress block grammar specification and tests rendering through the REST API block-renderer endpoint. It handles pattern versioning using post meta and supports import/export via the WordPress export format (WXR). Integration with theme.json allows pattern-aware theme development, and the agent can auto-generate pattern previews using the block preview component from @wordpress/block-editor.

# Notion AI Document Summarizer & Action Item Extractor

Notion AI Document Summarizer & Action Item Extractor is built around Notion workspace and database platform. The underlying ecosystem is represented by makenotion/notion-sdk-js (5,562+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like pages, databases.query, blocks.children, properties, relations, pagination and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.

For content workflows, the skill uses notion primitives as the system of record, so an agent can read structured inputs, apply transformations, and publish or sync output without losing metadata, IDs, or status fields. The original use case is clear: Uses the Notion SDK and Notion AI's /v1/pages and /v1/blocks/children endpoints to retrieve page content and invoke AI-powered summarization. Extracted action items are appended as a structured database entry via databases.query and pages.create. The implementation typically relies on pages, databases.query, blocks.children, properties, relations, pagination, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

Accesses pages, databases.query, blocks.children, properties, relations, pagination instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.

Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.

Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.

Fits into broader integration points such as knowledge bases, task tracking, content sync, and structured note workflows.

Key integration points include knowledge bases, task tracking, content sync, and structured note workflows. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

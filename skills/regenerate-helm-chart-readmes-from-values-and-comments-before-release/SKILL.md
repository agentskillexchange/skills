# Regenerate Helm chart READMEs from values and comments before release

Uses helm-docs to rebuild Helm chart documentation from Chart.yaml, values.yaml, and inline comments so README files stay aligned with the actual chart. The agent can run this before commit or release, then surface changed tables, missing descriptions, and documentation drift in a review-friendly diff.

3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

# Nginx Error Pattern Analyzer

The Nginx Error Pattern Analyzer processes Nginx error and access logs to identify recurring failure patterns and their root causes. It combines GoAccess for real-time log parsing with custom regex-based pattern matching to categorize errors by type, frequency, and impact.

The agent focuses on critical error patterns including upstream connection timeouts, 502 Bad Gateway spikes, 503 Service Unavailable patterns, SSL handshake failures, and rate limiting events. It correlates Nginx error timestamps with backend service metrics via Prometheus PromQL queries to establish causation between upstream service degradation and frontend errors.

Advanced analysis features include request path clustering to identify which API endpoints trigger the most errors, geographic correlation using GeoIP data, and time-series anomaly detection for unusual error rate spikes. The agent generates incident-ready reports with timeline visualizations, affected endpoint summaries, and recommended Nginx configuration changes (timeout adjustments, buffer sizes, retry policies) to mitigate identified issues.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**

2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# ArgoCD Sync Wave Planner

Overview
The ArgoCD Sync Wave Planner manages complex Kubernetes deployment ordering through ArgoCD’s sync wave and hook mechanism. It ensures infrastructure components deploy before application workloads by analyzing resource dependencies and configuring appropriate argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave annotations.


Key Capabilities
This skill uses the ArgoCD REST API to inspect Application sync status, health checks, and resource tree structures. It runs kubectl diff against live cluster state and renders Helm templates to validate manifests before triggering sync operations. Integration with Argo Rollouts enables progressive delivery strategies including canary deployments and blue-green cutover with automated analysis.


Deployment Workflow
Manages PreSync hooks for database migrations, Sync hooks for deployment coordination, and PostSync hooks for smoke tests and notification dispatch. Supports ApplicationSet generators for multi-cluster fleet management and integrates with Argo Notifications for Slack and webhook-based deployment tracking across environments.

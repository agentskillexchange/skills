# CircleCI Config Validator

The CircleCI Config Validator skill ensures CircleCI pipeline configurations are correct, efficient, and follow best practices. It uses the CircleCI v2 API to fetch pipeline definitions, workflow structures, and job configurations for analysis. The circleci config validate command is invoked to catch syntax errors and schema violations before commits. The skill analyzes orb usage patterns, recommending version pinning and identifying deprecated orb features. Parallelism settings are evaluated against test suite sizes to optimize execution time. Resource class allocation is reviewed to balance cost and performance, suggesting machine executor upgrades or Docker image optimizations where beneficial. The skill also checks for proper caching strategies, workspace persistence between jobs, and approval job configurations for deployment gates.

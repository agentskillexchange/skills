# Audit and normalize SPDX license headers before releasing or open-sourcing a repository

Use REUSE when an agent needs file-level licensing clarity instead of guessing from a single top-level LICENSE file. The agent checks compliance, adds or verifies SPDX headers, pulls missing license texts into LICENSES/, and produces a concrete remediation list or SPDX export.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

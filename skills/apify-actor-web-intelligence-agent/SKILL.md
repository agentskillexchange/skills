description: "This skill builds and deploys web intelligence gathering actors on the Apify cloud platform using the Apify SDK. It leverages CheerioCrawler for fast static page processing and PlaywrightCrawler for JavaScript-heavy sites, with automatic crawler selection based on target site analysis. The RequestQueue API manages URL frontier with deduplication, priority ordering, and retry logic. Extracted data flows into Apify Datasets with automatic schema validation and export to formats including JSON, CSV, and Excel. The skill uses KeyValueStore for caching intermediate results and storing crawler state for resumable runs. Production features include automatic proxy rotation via Apify Proxy with residential and datacenter pools, session management for maintaining login state across requests, and auto-scaling that adjusts concurrency based on target site response times. Webhook integrations trigger downstream workflows when actor runs complete, enabling automated data pipelines."

# Anthropic SDK Token Usage Logger

Instruments Anthropic API calls to log token usage, latency, and cost per request using the Anthropic TypeScript SDK. Wraps the anthropic.messages.create method to capture usage.input_tokens, usage.output_tokens, and timing from the API response. Writes structured logs to CloudWatch Logs via the AWS SDK v3 CloudWatchLogsClient.

# Semgrep SAST Scanner

Overview
Runs Semgrep static analysis with custom rule packs targeting OWASP Top 10 patterns. Uses semgrep CLI with –config=auto and –sarif output for GitHub Advanced Security integration and CWE-tagged finding reports.

Key Features

Automated detection and reporting with structured output formats for downstream integrations
Configurable thresholds and rule sets that adapt to project-specific requirements and team conventions
Real-time feedback loops integrated into developer workflows for immediate actionable insights
Comprehensive logging and audit trails for compliance tracking and historical trend analysis

How It Works
Semgrep SAST Scanner connects directly to your existing infrastructure through well-documented API endpoints. It authenticates using standard token-based methods (API keys, OAuth tokens, or service account credentials) and operates within your existing permission boundaries. The skill processes incoming data streams, applies configurable analysis rules, and produces structured reports that integrate with notification systems, dashboards, and issue trackers.

Requirements

Valid API credentials with appropriate read/write scopes for the target service
Network access to the relevant API endpoints from the agent runtime environment
Compatible agent framework installed and configured with the necessary SDK dependencies

## Installation

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# Jira Advanced Query Agent

Jira Advanced Query Agent is built around Jira issue tracking platform. It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like JQL, issues, workflows, comments, transitions, custom fields, sprint APIs and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.
The skill is especially useful when an agent needs to translate a natural-language request into concrete jira-level queries, run them safely, and then explain the result in operational terms rather than returning raw output. The implementation typically relies on JQL, issues, workflows, comments, transitions, custom fields, sprint APIs, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

Accesses JQL, issues, workflows, comments, transitions, custom fields, sprint APIs instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.
Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.
Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.
Fits into broader integration points such as ticket triage, sprint planning, incident tracking, and project automation.

 Key integration points include ticket triage, sprint planning, incident tracking, and project automation. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

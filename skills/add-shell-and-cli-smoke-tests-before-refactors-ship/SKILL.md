# Add executable smoke tests for shell scripts and CLIs before refactors ship

Use Bats-core when an agent needs to turn fragile shell scripts or command-line workflows into something it can verify repeatedly after edits. The agent writes focused Bash tests for success paths, failure paths, and output contracts, then runs them locally or in CI before a refactor, release, or incident fix goes out.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

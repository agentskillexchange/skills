# ESLint Rule Generator Agent

The ESLint Rule Generator Agent automates the creation of custom ESLint rules by translating natural language specifications into valid ESLint rule definitions. It leverages the ESLint RuleTester API to validate generated rules against test cases, ensuring correctness before deployment. The agent parses JavaScript and TypeScript ASTs using espree and typescript-eslint, identifying the correct AST node types and selectors for each rule pattern. It supports auto-fixable rules with context.report() fix functions, generates comprehensive documentation with rule metadata, and can publish rules as shareable ESLint plugins via npm. The agent handles edge cases like JSX parsing, decorator support, and module vs script source types. Built for teams that need project-specific linting rules without deep AST knowledge.

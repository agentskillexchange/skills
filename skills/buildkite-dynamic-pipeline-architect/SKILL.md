title: "Buildkite Dynamic Pipeline Architect"
description: "The Buildkite Dynamic Pipeline Architect enables intelligent, change-driven CI/CD pipelines on the Buildkite platform. It uses the Buildkite REST API for pipeline management and the dynamic pipeline upload mechanism to generate steps at runtime based on repository changes. The skill analyzes git diff output to determine which components of a monorepo have changed, then generates targeted pipeline steps only for affected services. It supports Buildkite-specific features including block steps for manual approvals, group steps for logical organization, wait steps with continue_on_failure semantics, and trigger steps for cross-pipeline orchestration. Agent targeting is handled through queue and tag-based routing, with automatic retry configuration based on historical flakiness data fetched via the Buildkite GraphQL API. The architect generates pipeline YAML with proper artifact passing between steps, plugin configurations for Docker and docker-compose, and notification hooks for Slack and PagerDuty integration."

# OpenAPI Spec Validator & Linter

The OpenAPI Spec Validator & Linter skill provides comprehensive validation and linting for OpenAPI specifications. It uses @readme/openapi-parser for structural validation against the OpenAPI 3.0.x and 3.1.x JSON Schema, and Stoplight Spectral (@stoplight/spectral-core) for style and best-practice linting.
Structural validation catches: invalid $ref pointers, missing required fields (info, paths, responses), malformed schema compositions (allOf/oneOf/anyOf cycles), and discriminator mapping errors. The parser resolves external references and detects circular dependencies.
Spectral linting applies configurable rulesets including: oas3-api-servers (server URL validation), operation-description (missing endpoint docs), operation-operationId-valid-in-url (naming conventions), no-$ref-siblings (spec compliance), and typed-enum (enum value consistency). Custom rules detect company-specific patterns like missing rate-limit headers, inconsistent pagination parameters, and non-standard error response schemas.
The skill generates a prioritized report with: critical errors blocking code generation, warnings affecting developer experience, informational suggestions for API consistency, and auto-fix suggestions for common issues like adding missing operationIds or normalizing path parameter naming from camelCase to snake_case.

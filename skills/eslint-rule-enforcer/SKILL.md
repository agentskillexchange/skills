# ESLint Rule Enforcer

Overview Automates ESLint v9 flat config enforcement across monorepos using eslint-plugin-unicorn and @typescript-eslint/parser. Scans changed files via git diff, applies auto-fixable rules, and generates per-package lint reports with violation severity breakdowns.

Key Features

- Automated detection and reporting with structured output formats for downstream integrations

- Configurable thresholds and rule sets that adapt to project-specific requirements and team conventions

- Real-time feedback loops integrated into developer workflows for immediate actionable insights

- Comprehensive logging and audit trails for compliance tracking and historical trend analysis

How It Works ESLint Rule Enforcer connects directly to your existing infrastructure through well-documented API endpoints. It authenticates using standard token-based methods (API keys, OAuth tokens, or service account credentials) and operates within your existing permission boundaries. The skill processes incoming data streams, applies configurable analysis rules, and produces structured reports that integrate with notification systems, dashboards, and issue trackers.

Requirements

- Valid API credentials with appropriate read/write scopes for the target service

- Network access to the relevant API endpoints from the agent runtime environment

- Compatible agent framework installed and configured with the necessary SDK dependencies

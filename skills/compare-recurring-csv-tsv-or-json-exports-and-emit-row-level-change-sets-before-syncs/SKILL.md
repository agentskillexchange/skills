# Compare recurring CSV, TSV, or JSON exports and emit row-level change sets before syncs

Use csv-diff when an agent needs to explain what changed between two structured exports, not just that the files differ. The agent lines records up by a stable key, reports added, removed, and changed rows, and can hand the result to humans or downstream automations as readable text or machine-friendly JSON.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

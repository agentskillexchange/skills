# OPA Rego Policy Bundle Tester

OPA Rego Policy Bundle Tester is built for teams that want policy review to be concrete, reproducible, and tied to real evaluation outputs. It uses Open Policy Agent APIs such as /v1/data and /v1/compile, along with the logic behind opa test, to inspect how a request would be evaluated against a bundle of Rego rules. That makes it useful for authorization checks, deployment guardrails, and environment policy changes where a vague “policy failed” message is not enough.

The skill can explain which inputs were matched, which rules fired, and how a decision was reached. It is especially helpful before releasing policy bundle updates, because it can compare expected decisions against actual evaluation results and catch broken assumptions early. In practice, that shortens the feedback loop between policy authors and the application or platform teams that depend on them.

Use this skill when agents need to validate Rego bundle behavior, summarize policy decisions for humans, and keep authorization or compliance rules from becoming opaque operational black boxes.

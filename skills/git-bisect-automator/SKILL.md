# Git Bisect Automator

The Git Bisect Automator skill streamlines regression hunting by automating git bisect sessions with configurable test harnesses. It wraps the Git CLI bisect commands (start, good, bad, run, skip) with intelligent test script management, supporting unit tests, integration tests, and custom validation scripts as bisect criteria. The skill integrates with GitHub Actions API to trigger CI pipelines on bisect candidate commits, collecting pass/fail results without local build requirements. Features include parallel bisect execution across multiple test suites, automatic skip of known-broken commits via git notes, and bisect log analysis for identifying flaky test interference. Supports repository submodule-aware bisection, worktree-based concurrent testing for faster narrowing, and automated blame annotation with commit message context extraction.

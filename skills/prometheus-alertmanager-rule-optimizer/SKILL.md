# Prometheus AlertManager Rule Optimizer

The Prometheus AlertManager Rule Optimizer tackles alert fatigue by performing deep analysis of your Prometheus alerting rules and AlertManager routing configuration. It connects to the Prometheus HTTP API to fetch rule definitions, evaluate PromQL expressions, and retrieve historical alert firing data.

The optimizer identifies common anti-patterns: overly sensitive thresholds that fire on transient spikes, redundant rules that generate duplicate alerts, missing inhibition rules that should suppress correlated alerts, and poorly configured group_wait/group_interval/repeat_interval timings. It produces actionable recommendations with before/after PromQL comparisons.

Additionally, it analyzes AlertManager routing trees to detect dead routes, overlapping matchers, and missing fallback receivers. The agent generates optimized YAML configurations that can be applied directly, along with a simulation report showing projected alert volume reduction. Supports integration with Grafana Annotations API to mark optimization events on dashboards.

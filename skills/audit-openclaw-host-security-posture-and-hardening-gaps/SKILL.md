# Audit OpenClaw host security posture and hardening gaps

This skill uses OpenClaw’s healthcheck workflow to inspect the host running the assistant, surface risky exposure, and turn the findings into a staged hardening plan. It is for operator-style audits with explicit approval gates, not a generic software listing or a replacement for OS administration.

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.

3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.

# GitLab Pipeline DAG Optimizer

Overview
The GitLab Pipeline DAG Optimizer analyzes your .gitlab-ci.yml configurations to identify pipeline bottlenecks and restructure job dependencies for maximum parallelism. It uses the GitLab Pipelines API to fetch historical execution data and identify critical path inefficiencies.

Key Capabilities
This skill maps out directed acyclic graph (DAG) dependencies using the needs: keyword relationships, identifying jobs that can run in parallel but are unnecessarily serialized. It integrates with gitlab-runner exec for local pipeline simulation and validates optimized configurations before pushing changes. The optimizer also leverages the Merge Request Approvals API to enforce pipeline performance gates.

Optimization Strategies
Implements pipeline sectioning with rules: and workflow: blocks to skip irrelevant stages, configures interruptible: flags for redundant pipeline cancellation, and tunes runner tag assignments based on job resource requirements. Supports multi-project pipeline triggers and downstream pipeline dependency management for monorepo architectures.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

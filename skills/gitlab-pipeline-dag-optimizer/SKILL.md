# GitLab Pipeline DAG Optimizer

Overview The GitLab Pipeline DAG Optimizer analyzes your .gitlab-ci.yml configurations to identify pipeline bottlenecks and restructure job dependencies for maximum parallelism. It uses the GitLab Pipelines API to fetch historical execution data and identify critical path inefficiencies.

Key Capabilities This skill maps out directed acyclic graph (DAG) dependencies using the needs: keyword relationships, identifying jobs that can run in parallel but are unnecessarily serialized. It integrates with gitlab-runner exec for local pipeline simulation and validates optimized configurations before pushing changes. The optimizer also leverages the Merge Request Approvals API to enforce pipeline performance gates.

Optimization Strategies Implements pipeline sectioning with rules: and workflow: blocks to skip irrelevant stages, configures interruptible: flags for redundant pipeline cancellation, and tunes runner tag assignments based on job resource requirements. Supports multi-project pipeline triggers and downstream pipeline dependency management for monorepo architectures.

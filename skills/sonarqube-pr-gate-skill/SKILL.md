# SonarQube PR Gate

Integrates SonarQube quality gates into pull request workflows via the SonarQube Web API /api/qualitygates/project_status. Blocks merges when code smells, duplications, or coverage thresholds fail and posts inline annotations using the GitHub Checks API.

## Installation

Use the upstream install or setup path that matches your environment:
- Make sure that you follow our [code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#code-style) and all tests are passing (Travis build is executed for each pull request).
- yarn
- yarn build
- yarn generate-translation-keys

Requirements and caveats from upstream:
- Native Git - Must be installed and available in your PATH
- But if your contribution also contains UI changes, you must clone the sonarqube-webapp repository, do your changes there, build it locally and then build the sonarqube repository using the WEBAPP_BUILD_PATH environmen...

Basic usage or getting-started notes:
- Java 17 - Required to build the project
- npm - Required for building
- Tests - Can be disabled if needed by adding -x test to the gradle command (useful if you just want to build without running tests)

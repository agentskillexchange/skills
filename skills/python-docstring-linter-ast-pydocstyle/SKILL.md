Auto-generation mode creates skeleton docstrings from function signatures, including parameter types inferred from mypy type checking results. It validates example code blocks within docstrings by executing them as doctests, reporting failures inline. Integration with Sphinx autodoc ensures generated documentation renders correctly.

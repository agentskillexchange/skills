# Mirror GitHub issues, pull requests, commits, and releases into SQLite for offline analysis

Use dogsheep/github-to-sqlite when an agent needs a local, queryable snapshot of GitHub activity instead of bouncing through the web UI or ad hoc API calls. The agent authenticates once, pulls the exact GitHub objects it needs, and leaves behind a SQLite database that can be inspected, joined, diffed, or handed to downstream tools.

## Installation

Choose the method that fits your setup:

1. Clone or download this repo and copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange repo with your preferred Git workflow.
3. Add the skill folder as a git submodule if you manage skills as dependencies.
4. Copy the files manually into a local custom-skills directory for testing.
5. Use any marketplace or sync tooling you already have for pulling ASE skills.

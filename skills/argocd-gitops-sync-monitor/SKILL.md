# ArgoCD GitOps Sync Monitor

The ArgoCD GitOps Sync Monitor provides real-time monitoring of ArgoCD application synchronization status across Kubernetes clusters. It connects to the ArgoCD REST API /api/v1/applications endpoint to poll sync states, health statuses, and revision histories. The skill detects configuration drift by comparing Git repository manifests against live cluster state via the Kubernetes API, identifying out-of-sync resources and unauthorized manual changes. It supports multi-cluster setups through the ArgoCD cluster API, monitoring applications across development, staging, and production environments. Automated alerting triggers notifications for sync failures, degraded health conditions, and resource hook failures. The monitor integrates with the ArgoCD ApplicationSet API to validate generator configurations and template rendering. It generates drift reports showing exact resource differences using structured diff comparisons, and provides one-click sync triggers through the ArgoCD sync API with configurable prune and force options.

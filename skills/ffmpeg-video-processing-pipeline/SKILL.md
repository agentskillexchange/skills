# FFmpeg Video Processing Pipeline

The FFmpeg Video Processing Pipeline constructs sophisticated filtergraph chains for professional video workflows. It handles batch transcoding across codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1, VP9) with configurable CRF/bitrate targets, two-pass encoding, and per-title encoding optimization that selects bitrate ladders based on content complexity analysis.

Hardware acceleration is supported via NVIDIA NVENC, Intel QuickSync (QSV), and Apple VideoToolbox, with automatic fallback to software encoding when GPU resources are unavailable. HDR workflows include PQ-to-HLG conversion, HDR10+ dynamic metadata passthrough, and Dolby Vision profile 8.1 remuxing.

The skill generates thumbnail sprite sheets (WebVTT + contact sheet images) for video player scrubbing, creates HLS and DASH adaptive streaming packages with proper segment alignment, and handles audio normalization via EBU R128 loudness standards. Subtitle extraction (SRT, ASS, VobSub OCR) and burn-in with configurable styling round out the post-production capabilities. Scene detection via ffprobe enables intelligent chapter marker generation.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

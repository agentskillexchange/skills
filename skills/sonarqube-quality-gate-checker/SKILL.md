# SonarQube Quality Gate Checker

The SonarQube Quality Gate Checker skill monitors and enforces code quality standards by interfacing with the SonarQube Web API. It queries the /api/qualitygates/project_status endpoint to retrieve real-time quality gate pass/fail results and detailed condition evaluations for metrics like coverage, duplications, and maintainability rating.


The skill integrates with sonar-scanner CLI to trigger on-demand code analysis, supporting configuration via sonar-project.properties files and command-line parameter overrides. It reads analysis reports from the .scannerwork/report-task.txt file to track background task completion via the /api/ce/task endpoint before fetching results.


Key capabilities include retrieving project-level metrics through /api/measures/component with metricKeys for coverage, bugs, vulnerabilities, code_smells, and ncloc. It supports branch and pull request analysis via the /api/project_branches/list and /api/project_pull_requests/list endpoints. The skill also manages quality profiles through /api/qualityprofiles/search for language-specific rule configuration.


Advanced features include hotspot review tracking via /api/hotspots/search, security report generation using /api/issues/search with type filters, custom quality gate creation through /api/qualitygates/create, and webhook management for CI/CD callback integration via /api/webhooks/list.

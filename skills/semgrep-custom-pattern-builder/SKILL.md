# Semgrep Custom Pattern Builder

The Semgrep Custom Pattern Builder creates targeted static analysis rules using the Semgrep pattern matching engine. It leverages the semgrep CLI for rule testing and the Semgrep Registry API for rule sharing and collaboration.

The skill generates YAML rule definitions with sophisticated pattern constructs including metavariable-pattern for type-constrained matching, pattern-either for multi-variant detection, pattern-inside for scope-limited scanning, and taint mode configurations for tracking data flow from sources to sinks. Each rule includes autofix patterns that provide automated remediation.

Rule development workflow includes generating test files with annotated expected findings, running semgrep –test for validation, and producing detailed rule documentation. The builder supports language-specific patterns across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java, and Ruby with generic pattern mode for framework-agnostic rules. It also generates Semgrep CI configurations for GitHub Actions and GitLab CI integration.

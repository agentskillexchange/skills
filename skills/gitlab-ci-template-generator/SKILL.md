# GitLab CI Template Generator

The GitLab CI Template Generator skill produces comprehensive .gitlab-ci.yml configurations leveraging GitLab native CI/CD features and templates. It integrates the Auto DevOps template includes for standardized build-test-deploy stages, uses gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor for rootless container image building without Docker-in-Docker, and configures the SAST and DAST security scanning templates. The skill generates pipeline configurations with proper cache policies using cache:key:files for lock-file-based cache invalidation, artifacts:reports for code quality and test coverage reporting, and rules-based job inclusion replacing the deprecated only/except syntax. It handles environment-specific deployments with environment:url and environment:auto_stop_in for review app lifecycle management. Multi-project pipeline support includes trigger jobs with strategy:depend for downstream pipeline monitoring, bridge jobs for cross-project artifact dependencies, and parent-child pipelines using trigger:include for modular configuration. The skill also configures GitLab Releases API integration for automated release creation with release-cli and generates proper services configurations for integration testing with PostgreSQL, Redis, and Elasticsearch containers.

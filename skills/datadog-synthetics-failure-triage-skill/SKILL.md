# Datadog Synthetics Failure Triage Skill

Datadog Synthetics Failure Triage Skill helps agents move from a failed synthetic result to a grounded explanation of what probably went wrong. It relies on the Datadog Synthetics API for test runs and step details, the Monitors API for alert state and history, and the Logs Search API for the surrounding evidence. That makes it useful for browser journeys, API checks, and uptime monitors that fail intermittently and leave teams guessing whether the root cause is networking, auth, a backend regression, or a third-party dependency.

The workflow can inspect failure locations, compare the latest run against recent history, and correlate the failed step with logs, tags, and affected services. It is also a good fit for organizations that want agents to prepare a concise triage packet before a human jumps in. Instead of handing off only a failing test name, the skill can surface monitor state, timestamps, environment tags, and the most relevant error traces.

Use this skill when synthetic monitoring is already in place but the first investigation step still takes too long and too much manual dashboard hopping.

## Installation

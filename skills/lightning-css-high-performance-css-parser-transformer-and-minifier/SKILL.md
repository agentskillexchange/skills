description: "Lightning CSS is an open source CSS engine from the Parcel project that gives agents a fast, source-backed way to parse, transform, prefix, and minify stylesheets. It is written in Rust and published as the lightningcss npm package, with a standalone CLI, a JavaScript API, and Rust library support. The project is designed for build tooling and automation scenarios where an agent needs to make CSS changes safely and then produce browser-compatible output without chaining multiple separate tools. This skill is useful when the job is to modernize CSS, reduce bundle size, or generate production-ready styles from newer syntax. Lightning CSS can lower CSS nesting, logical properties, modern color syntax, media query ranges, and other features based on browser targets. It also handles vendor prefixing and minification in one pass, which makes it a strong fit for agent workflows that need speed, deterministic output, and fewer moving parts than a PostCSS plugin stack. Integration points are straightforward. Agents can call the npm package from Node.js build scripts, use the CLI inside CI pipelines, or wire it into Parcel and other bundlers. Because the project exposes real AST-aware transforms, it is better suited than string-based rewrites for tasks like stylesheet cleanup, output normalization, and compatibility preparation. For teams working on design systems, web apps, or static-site pipelines, this skill gives an agent a real upstream tool with maintained docs, active releases, and a clear installation path."

# Lightning CSS High-Performance CSS Parser Transformer and Minifier

Lightning CSS is an open source CSS engine from the Parcel project that gives agents a fast, source-backed way to parse, transform, prefix, and minify stylesheets.

Security analysis includes: CVE vulnerability reports with CVSS v3.1 scores and vector strings, transitive dependency vulnerability tracing showing the full dependency chain, exploit availability indicators from GitHub Advisory Database (GHSA) cross-references, and fix availability status with recommended semver-compatible upgrade paths. License compliance generates: a full dependency license matrix (MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC, BSD, GPL variants), compatibility analysis against your project license, SPDX expression parsing for dual-licensed packages, and flagging of packages with no license field or custom/proprietary licenses. Package health metrics from the registry API include: weekly download trends (flagging >50% decline as potential abandonment), last publish date (warning if >2 years), maintainer count and bus factor analysis, and GitHub stars/issues ratio as a maintenance indicator. The skill outputs actionable reports with prioritized remediation steps: critical CVE patches, license violation resolutions, and suggested replacements for abandoned packages."

The NPM Package Audit &#038; License Checker skill performs comprehensive security and compliance analysis of Node.js project dependencies.

# Reddit Subreddit Sentiment Tracker

Uses the Reddit OAuth2 API via PRAW to collect top posts and comments from subreddits on a rolling 24-hour window, then runs batch sentiment scoring via HuggingFace Inference API using twitter-roberta-base-sentiment. Aggregates scores into a daily time-series written to Google Sheets for Looker Studio visualization. Fires Slack alerts when sentiment drops more than 20 points week-over-week.

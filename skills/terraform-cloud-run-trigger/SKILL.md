# Terraform Cloud Run Trigger

Automates Terraform Cloud workspace runs using the TFC API v2. Creates runs via POST /api/v2/runs with plan-only or auto-apply modes, streams plan output from /api/v2/plans/{id}/log, and manages workspace variables through /api/v2/workspaces/{id}/vars for infrastructure-as-code pipelines.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

The Python PyPI Dependency Resolver skill provides intelligent dependency management for Python projects. Using the PyPI JSON API, it fetches package metadata including version histories, dependency specifications, and platform compatibility markers. The pip dependency resolver algorithm is implemented to find compatible version sets across complex dependency graphs, handling conflicts and backtracking scenarios. The skill generates fully locked requirements files with pinned versions and hash verification for reproducible builds. Python version marker evaluation using the packaging library ensures dependencies are compatible with target Python versions. Virtual environment integration supports creating isolated environments with resolved dependencies. The skill also analyzes dependency update impact by comparing current and latest versions, identifying breaking changes through changelog parsing, and running compatibility checks against project test suites.

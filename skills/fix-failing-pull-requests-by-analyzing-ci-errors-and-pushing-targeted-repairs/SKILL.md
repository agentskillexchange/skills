# Fix failing pull requests by analyzing CI errors and pushing targeted repairs

Use GitHub Next’s pr-fix workflow when a pull request is blocked on failing checks and the likely repair is machine-doable. The agent inspects CI failures, traces the root cause, applies a focused fix on the PR branch, and leaves the result in reviewable Git history.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

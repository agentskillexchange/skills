# Fix failing pull requests by analyzing CI errors and pushing targeted repairs

Use GitHub Next&#8217;s pr-fix workflow when a pull request is blocked on failing checks and the likely repair is machine-doable. The agent inspects CI failures, traces the root cause, applies a focused fix on the PR branch, and leaves the result in reviewable Git history.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

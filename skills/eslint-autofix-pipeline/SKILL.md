# ESLint Auto-Fix Pipeline

The ESLint Auto-Fix Pipeline agent automates code linting and correction for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It executes ESLint programmatically using the ESLint Node.js API (new ESLint({ fix: true })) with configurable rule sets including eslint-config-airbnb, @typescript-eslint/recommended, and eslint-plugin-react.

The agent processes files in batches, applying auto-fixable corrections for spacing, semicolons, import ordering, unused variables, and other style violations. For issues that cannot be auto-fixed, it generates structured diff reports highlighting the exact lines and suggested remediation steps.

Supports integration with Prettier for formatting conflicts resolution via eslint-config-prettier and eslint-plugin-prettier. The pipeline can be configured to run as a pre-commit hook or as part of a CI workflow, with exit codes reflecting the severity of remaining issues. Handles monorepo configurations with cascading eslintrc files and workspace-level overrides.

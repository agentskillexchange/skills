# Apache Kafka Schema Registry Validator

The Apache Kafka Schema Registry Validator skill ensures data contract integrity across event-driven architectures by validating schema changes against Confluent Schema Registry. It uses the Schema Registry REST API to test compatibility of new Avro, Protobuf, and JSON Schema versions before they are registered, preventing breaking changes from reaching production consumers.
The skill supports all Confluent compatibility modes: BACKWARD (new schema can read old data), FORWARD (old schema can read new data), FULL (both directions), and TRANSITIVE variants that check against all previous versions rather than just the latest. It analyzes proposed schema changes to identify specific incompatible modifications like field removal, type narrowing, or default value changes.
Additional features include schema diff visualization showing added, removed, and modified fields between versions, subject naming strategy validation for TopicNameStrategy and RecordNameStrategy patterns, cross-subject compatibility checking for schemas shared across topics, and integration with Kafka Connect to verify converter configurations match registered schemas. The skill outputs actionable remediation suggestions when incompatibilities are detected.

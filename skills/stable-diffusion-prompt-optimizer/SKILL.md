Negative prompts are auto-generated based on the positive prompt content using an embedded quality-tag database covering common artifacts like extra fingers, blurry backgrounds, and watermarks. The skill queries /sdapi/v1/sd-models to match prompts with appropriate checkpoint models and uses /sdapi/v1/samplers to recommend optimal sampler settings.

# npm Audit Dependency Report Generator

This skill processes npm audit output to produce enriched vulnerability reports for JavaScript and TypeScript projects. It parses the JSON output from npm audit –json, then cross-references each vulnerability identifier with the OSV API at https://api.osv.dev/v1/query and the NVD REST API at https://services.nvd.nist.gov/rest/json/cves/2.0 for CVSS base scores and vector strings. Findings are grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and include affected package versions, patched versions, and dependency paths. The skill generates SARIF 2.1 output compatible with GitHub Advanced Security code scanning and supports uploading results to GitHub via the code-scanning/sarifs API endpoint. It also integrates with Jira to create tickets for Critical and High findings using the Jira REST API v3.

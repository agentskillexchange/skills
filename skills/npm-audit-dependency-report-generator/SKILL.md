Findings are grouped by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low) and include affected package versions, patched versions, and dependency paths. The skill generates SARIF 2.1 output compatible with GitHub Advanced Security code scanning and supports uploading results to GitHub via the code-scanning/sarifs API endpoint. It also integrates with Jira to create tickets for Critical and High findings using the Jira REST API v3."

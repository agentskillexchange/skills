# Discord Bot Manager

Discord Bot Manager is built around Discord bot and moderation platform. The underlying ecosystem is represented by discordjs/discord.js (26,650+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like gateway events, slash commands, REST API, webhooks, intents, role actions and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.
In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to discord so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The implementation typically relies on gateway events, slash commands, REST API, webhooks, intents, role actions, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

Accesses gateway events, slash commands, REST API, webhooks, intents, role actions instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.
Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.
Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.
Fits into broader integration points such as community bots, moderation, logging, and workflow notifications.

 Key integration points include community bots, moderation, logging, and workflow notifications. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

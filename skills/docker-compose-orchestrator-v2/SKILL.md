description: "Docker Compose Orchestrator provides intelligent management of multi-service Docker environments through the Compose V2 specification. It uses the Docker Engine SDK for Go to monitor container health, manage network overlays, and orchestrate rolling updates with configurable parallelism. The tool analyzes depends_on chains to determine optimal startup ordering, implements custom health check retry logic beyond what Docker natively supports, and provides real-time log aggregation across services. It supports Docker Compose profiles for environment-specific configurations, volume backup and restore operations, and automatic image pruning based on retention policies. Integration with Docker BuildKit enables optimized multi-stage builds with layer caching analytics. The tool exposes Prometheus metrics for container resource utilization tracking."

# Docker Compose Orchestrator

Docker Compose Orchestrator provides intelligent management of multi-service Docker environments through the Compose V2 specification. It uses the Docker Engine SDK for Go to monitor container health, manage network overlays, and orchestrate rolling updates with configurable parallelism. The tool analyzes depends_on chains to determine optimal startup ordering, implements custom health check retry logic beyond what Docker natively supports, and provides real-time log aggregation across services. It supports Docker Compose profiles for environment-specific configurations, volume backup and restore operations, and automatic image pruning based on retention policies. Integration with Docker BuildKit enables optimized multi-stage builds with layer caching analytics. The tool exposes Prometheus metrics for container resource utilization tracking.

# Task Taskfile Build Automation Runner

Task (go-task/task) is a fast, cross-platform build tool inspired by Make but designed for modern development workflows. It uses simple YAML-based Taskfiles instead of Makefiles, eliminating the quirks and complexity of Make syntax while providing a more readable and maintainable way to define project commands and build steps.

The Task runner reads a Taskfile.yml in your project directory and executes the defined tasks. Each task can specify commands, dependencies, environment variables, preconditions, and sources/generates for incremental builds. Task automatically detects file changes and skips execution when sources have not been modified, giving you fast incremental builds without manual cache management.

Key capabilities include task dependency resolution (run tasks in order or in parallel), dynamic variables using shell commands, dotenv file loading, cross-platform compatibility (works identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows), and a built-in watch mode for automatic re-execution on file changes. Task also supports task namespacing through included Taskfiles, allowing you to compose build systems across multiple projects or modules.

This skill enables agents to generate, modify, and execute Taskfiles for project automation. Agents can scaffold Taskfile.yml configs for new projects, add build/test/lint/deploy tasks, resolve task dependency chains, and run specific tasks with variable overrides. The skill outputs task execution results, dependency graphs, and Taskfile validation reports.

Integration points include CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), Docker-based builds, monorepo setups with included Taskfiles, and local development workflows. Task is distributed as a single binary with zero dependencies, installable via Homebrew, snap, go install, or direct download from GitHub releases.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

# Semgrep Security Scanner

The Semgrep Security Scanner skill leverages the Semgrep CLI and Semgrep Registry to perform fast, pattern-based static analysis across 30+ programming languages. It uses the semgrep scan command with configurable rulesets from the Semgrep Registry (p/default, p/owasp-top-ten, p/security-audit) and supports custom rule definitions in YAML using Semgrep pattern syntax including pattern-either, pattern-inside, and metavariable-comparison operators. The skill handles monorepo scanning with path filtering via -include and -exclude flags, generates SARIF reports for GitHub Code Scanning integration, and produces JSON output for programmatic processing. It supports Semgrep App integration for diff-aware scanning in CI pipelines via -baseline-commit, manages findings with triage states (open, ignored, fixed), and can autofix certain patterns using the fix: key in custom rules. The scanner also supports secrets detection via p/secrets ruleset and supply chain analysis for dependency vulnerabilities.

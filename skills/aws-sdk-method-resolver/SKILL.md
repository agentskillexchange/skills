# AWS SDK Method Resolver

The AWS SDK Method Resolver indexes the complete AWS SDK v3 modular client surface across 300+ service packages. Given a task description, it identifies the correct @aws-sdk client package, command class, and input/output type interfaces. The skill maps each API call to its required IAM actions and resource ARN patterns, enabling least-privilege policy generation. It understands credential provider chains including SSO, AssumeRole, and container credential providers. For S3 operations, it handles multipart upload orchestration, presigned URL generation with expiry calculations, and server-side encryption configurations. DynamoDB queries get optimized with proper KeyConditionExpression construction, projection expressions, and consistent read strategies. The resolver also covers CloudFormation resource type schemas, helping translate infrastructure intent into correct template properties with dependency ordering.

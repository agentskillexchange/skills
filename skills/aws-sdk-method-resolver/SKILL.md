It understands credential provider chains including SSO, AssumeRole, and container credential providers. For S3 operations, it handles multipart upload orchestration, presigned URL generation with expiry calculations, and server-side encryption configurations. DynamoDB queries get optimized with proper KeyConditionExpression construction, projection expressions, and consistent read strategies. The resolver also covers CloudFormation resource type schemas, helping translate infrastructure intent into correct template properties with dependency ordering.

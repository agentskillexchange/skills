# PostgreSQL Vacuum Deadlock Runbook

Overview
The PostgreSQL Vacuum Deadlock Runbook automates diagnosis and resolution of vacuum-related issues in PostgreSQL databases. It queries system catalog views to identify table bloat, long-running transactions blocking autovacuum, and lock contention patterns that degrade database performance.
Key Capabilities
This skill uses pg_stat_user_tables to monitor dead tuple accumulation, last vacuum timestamps, and autovacuum trigger thresholds. It queries pg_locks joined with pg_stat_activity to detect blocking relationships and identify transactions holding AccessExclusiveLock that prevent vacuum operations. The pgstattuple extension provides precise table and index bloat measurements.
Remediation Actions
Generates parameterized SQL for adjusting per-table autovacuum settings including autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor, autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay, and autovacuum_freeze_max_age. Handles wraparound vacuum emergencies by identifying tables approaching the 2-billion transaction ID limit and provides safe termination queries for blocking backends.

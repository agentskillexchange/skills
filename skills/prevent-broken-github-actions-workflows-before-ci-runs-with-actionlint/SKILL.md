# Prevent broken GitHub Actions workflows before CI runs with actionlint

Use actionlint when an agent needs to inspect GitHub Actions workflow files before a push or pull request lands. The skill checks syntax, expressions, action inputs, runner labels, cron patterns, and a few security footguns so the agent can stop bad workflow changes before CI burns time.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

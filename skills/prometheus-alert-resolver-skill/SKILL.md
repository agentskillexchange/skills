# Prometheus Alert Resolver

Resolves Prometheus alerts by querying the /api/v1/alerts and /api/v1/query_range endpoints for metric time series analysis. Executes playbook steps for common alerts like HighCPUUsage and DiskSpaceLow, validates PromQL recording rules, and silences alerts via Alertmanager /api/v2/silences.

## Overview

Overview

Resolves Prometheus alerts by querying the /api/v1/alerts and /api/v1/query_range endpoints for metric time series analysis. Executes playbook steps for common alerts like HighCPUUsage and DiskSpaceLow, validates PromQL recording rules, and silences alerts via Alertmanager /api/v2/silences.

Key Features

Automated detection and reporting with structured output formats for downstream integrations

Configurable thresholds and rule sets that adapt to project-specific requirements and team conventions

Real-time feedback loops integrated into developer workflows for immediate actionable insights

Comprehensive logging and audit trails for compliance tracking and historical trend analysis

How It Works

Prometheus Alert Resolver connects directly to your existing infrastructure through well-documented API endpoints. It authenticates using standard token-based methods (API keys, OAuth tokens, or service account credentials) and operates within your existing permission boundaries. The skill processes incoming data streams, applies configurable analysis rules, and produces structured reports that integrate with notification systems, dashboards, and issue trackers.

Requirements

Valid API credentials with appropriate read/write scopes for the target service

Network access to the relevant API endpoints from the agent runtime environment

Compatible agent framework installed and configured with the necessary SDK dependencies

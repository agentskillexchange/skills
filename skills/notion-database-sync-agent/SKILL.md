# Notion Database Sync Agent

Syncs records between Notion databases and external sources using the Notion API (POST /v1/databases/{id}/query), applying field mapping, deduplication by title or unique property, and incremental updates via last_edited_time filtering.

This skill queries a Notion database, maps its properties to a target schema, and syncs new/updated records to or from an external system (CSV, Airtable, Google Sheets, or a custom API). Handles Notion property types: title, rich_text, number, select, multi_select, date, checkbox, url, email, relation. Supports bidirectional sync with conflict resolution strategies (last_write_wins or source_wins).
Ideal for CRM backfill, project tracking exports, content pipeline management, and cross-tool data consistency. Not for Notion page content (only database properties). Not for databases with more than 100 relation properties — relation page traversal multiplies API calls significantly. Requires a Notion integration token with database read/write permissions and the integration connected to the target databases.

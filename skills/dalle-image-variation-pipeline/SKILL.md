# DALL-E Image Variation Pipeline

The DALL-E Image Variation Pipeline orchestrates OpenAI’s DALL-E 3 API for production image generation workflows. It manages prompt engineering with brand style guides, ensuring consistent visual identity across generated assets through systematic prompt templates and negative constraint specifications. The skill implements iterative refinement loops using GPT-4 Vision to evaluate generated images against style criteria, automatically adjusting prompts based on compositional analysis, color palette matching, and subject positioning feedback. Aspect ratio control supports standard formats (1:1, 16:9, 9:16) with intelligent prompt adaptation for each format. Batch generation manages API rate limits with exponential backoff, parallel request queuing, and cost tracking per project. Output processing includes automatic background removal via rembg, transparent PNG export, and metadata embedding with generation parameters for reproducibility. The pipeline integrates with asset management systems through configurable webhooks, uploading approved images to S3, Cloudinary, or DAM platforms with proper tagging and categorization. A/B testing support generates multiple variations with tracking IDs for performance measurement.

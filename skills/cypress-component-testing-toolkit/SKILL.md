# Cypress Component Testing Toolkit

The Cypress Component Testing Toolkit skill generates comprehensive test suites using Cypress for both component isolation and integration testing. It leverages the Cypress Testing Library API to write user-centric test queries based on accessibility roles, labels, and text content rather than implementation details. Network requests are controlled through cy.intercept for deterministic API stubbing, response delay simulation, and error scenario testing. Visual regression testing is configured via the Cypress Image Snapshot plugin with configurable diff thresholds, responsive breakpoint testing, and automatic baseline updates. Accessibility compliance is verified using cypress-axe, running WCAG 2.1 audits against rendered components with customizable rule sets and severity filtering. The skill supports React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte component mounting with proper provider wrapping for state management and routing contexts. It configures Cypress Cloud integration for test recording, flake detection through automatic retry analysis, and parallelization with intelligent test balancing across CI machines.

# Netdata Real-Time Infrastructure Monitoring and Alerting

Netdata is a mature open-source monitoring platform built for per-second infrastructure visibility. It collects metrics at the edge, renders dashboards locally, and can forward data into larger observability setups. A Netdata-focused skill is useful when an agent needs to install the Netdata Agent, verify a node is reporting correctly, inspect built-in collectors, tune alerting, or connect a machine to Netdata Cloud for multi-node views.
In practical use, the skill can walk through the documented one-line installer, confirm that the local dashboard is reachable on port 19999, and check which collectors are active for services such as nginx, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, or systemd. Because Netdata ships with streaming, anomaly detection, and many built-in alarms, the skill also fits troubleshooting workflows where an agent needs to explain why a host is noisy, which metrics moved first, or how to wire notifications into email, Slack, Discord, PagerDuty, or Telegram.
Integration points are straightforward and source-backed: the upstream repository documents installation methods, the Learn docs cover collector configuration and parent-child streaming, and releases are published regularly. This makes Netdata a strong intake candidate for ASE: real repo, real docs, clear job-to-be-done, active maintenance, and broad adoption. For agents, the main outputs are installation steps, collector setup guidance, alert routing instructions, and operational diagnostics for Linux, containers, cloud workloads, and hybrid environments.

# Kubernetes Pod Crash Loop Analyzer

Overview
The Kubernetes Pod Crash Loop Analyzer diagnoses pods stuck in CrashLoopBackOff state through systematic examination of container exit codes, event logs, and resource metrics. It automates the investigation workflow that SREs typically perform manually during incident response.

Key Capabilities
This skill runs kubectl describe pod to extract last termination reasons, exit codes (137 for OOMKill, 1 for application errors, 127 for missing binaries), and restart counts. It queries the Kubernetes Events API for related warnings and correlates OOMKilled signals with Prometheus container_memory_rss and container_memory_working_set_bytes metrics from cAdvisor.

Diagnostic Workflow
Examines init container failures, liveness and readiness probe misconfigurations, volume mount permission issues, and image pull backoff states. Cross-references node conditions from kubectl get nodes to identify resource pressure situations and generates remediation recommendations including resource limit adjustments, probe timeout tuning, and PodDisruptionBudget configurations.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

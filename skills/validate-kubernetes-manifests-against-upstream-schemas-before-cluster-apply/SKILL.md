# Validate Kubernetes manifests against upstream schemas before cluster apply

Uses kubeconform to validate Kubernetes manifests against versioned schemas before anything touches a cluster. The agent can review rendered Helm output, raw manifests, or PR diffs and return invalid resources, missing schemas, and strict-mode failures without requiring live cluster credentials.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

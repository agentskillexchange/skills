# Audit Python dependency declarations for unused, missing, and transitive imports before release

Use Deptry when an agent needs to verify that a Python project’s declared dependencies still match the imports the code actually uses. The agent scans the codebase, flags unused direct dependencies, missing declarations, and transitive imports that only work by accident, then turns the findings into cleanup commits or release blockers.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

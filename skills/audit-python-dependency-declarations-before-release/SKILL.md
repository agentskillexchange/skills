# Audit Python dependency declarations for unused, missing, and transitive imports before release

Use Deptry when an agent needs to verify that a Python project’s declared dependencies still match the imports the code actually uses. The agent scans the codebase, flags unused direct dependencies, missing declarations, and transitive imports that only work by accident, then turns the findings into cleanup commits or release blockers.

## Prerequisites

Python plus Deptry configured against the target repository

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

Install command or upstream instructions:

```
pip install deptry
```

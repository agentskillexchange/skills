# Load-test gRPC services from proto files and reusable request fixtures

This ASE skill uses ghz to run repeatable gRPC load tests from proto files, protosets, or server reflection. An agent can replay request fixtures at controlled concurrency, capture latency and error rates, and export machine-readable reports for regression checks or performance investigations.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

# ESLint Rule Conflict Resolver

The ESLint Rule Conflict Resolver identifies and resolves conflicting rule configurations across ESLint setup files. Using the ESLint Node.js API, it loads and merges configuration cascades from .eslintrc.js, .eslintrc.json, and flat config files to build a complete rule resolution map. The skill detects conflicts between popular config packages including eslint-config-airbnb, eslint-config-prettier, eslint-config-standard, and typescript-eslint recommended configurations. It analyzes rule severity overrides, option incompatibilities, and plugin version constraints using the eslint-plugin-import, eslint-plugin-react, and eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y APIs. The resolver generates a unified configuration that eliminates conflicts while preserving intent, with detailed explanations for each resolution decision. It supports migration from legacy .eslintrc format to the new ESLint flat config system, automatically translating extends chains into proper import statements and config arrays.

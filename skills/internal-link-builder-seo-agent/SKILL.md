The skill calculates internal PageRank distribution using the networkx Python library with customizable damping factors to identify pages that need more internal link equity. Orphan pages with zero internal links are automatically detected and matched with semantically related content using TF-IDF vectorization via scikit-learn. The skill generates specific linking recommendations with suggested anchor text variants that avoid over-optimization penalties. Content gap analysis identifies topical clusters with weak interconnection using community detection algorithms from the python-louvain library.

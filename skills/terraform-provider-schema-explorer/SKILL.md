It generates syntactically correct HCL blocks with proper attribute types including nested block structures, sets, and maps. For state management, it understands import block generation and moved block refactoring patterns. The explorer handles provider version constraints, feature flags, and experimental resource warnings. Supports multi-provider configurations with aliased providers and module-level variable passing with validation rules.

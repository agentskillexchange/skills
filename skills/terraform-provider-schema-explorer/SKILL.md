# Terraform Provider Schema Explorer

The Terraform Provider Schema Explorer parses the JSON schema output from terraform providers schema to build a navigable map of all resource types, data sources, and their attributes. It identifies required versus optional arguments, computed attributes, and sensitive fields across any installed provider. The skill resolves cross-resource references by tracing attribute dependencies—for example, linking aws_subnet.id references to aws_vpc.id through proper data flow. It generates syntactically correct HCL blocks with proper attribute types including nested block structures, sets, and maps. For state management, it understands import block generation and moved block refactoring patterns. The explorer handles provider version constraints, feature flags, and experimental resource warnings. Supports multi-provider configurations with aliased providers and module-level variable passing with validation rules.

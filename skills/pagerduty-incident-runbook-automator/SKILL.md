# PagerDuty Incident Runbook Automator

The PagerDuty Incident Runbook Automator skill integrates with the PagerDuty Events API v2 (events.pagerduty.com/v2/enqueue) and REST API (api.pagerduty.com) to automate incident response workflows. It creates incidents via the Events API with routing_key, event_action (trigger, acknowledge, resolve), and severity levels (critical, error, warning, info).
The skill manages incident lifecycle through REST API endpoints: POST /incidents for manual creation, PUT /incidents/{id} for status updates and reassignment, POST /incidents/{id}/notes for timeline annotations, and GET /incidents/{id}/log_entries for audit trail retrieval. It configures escalation policies using /escalation_policies with multi-level escalation rules and timeout-based progression.
Key capabilities include automated runbook execution triggered by webhook events (incident.trigger, incident.acknowledge), integration with monitoring tools via Events API v2 change events and alert grouping (time-based, intelligent, content-based), service dependency mapping through /service_dependencies for impact analysis, and response play automation with /response_plays for coordinated team mobilization. The automator also supports maintenance window management, on-call schedule rotation queries via /oncalls, and status page integration for external communication during incidents.

# Notion Task Sync Bridge

The Notion Task Sync Bridge skill establishes real-time bidirectional synchronization between Notion databases and external task management platforms. Using the Notion API v2022-06-28 with the databases/{id}/query POST endpoint, it polls for changes using the filter and sorts parameters. Property mapping supports all Notion property types including select, multi-select, date, relation, and rollup fields. The skill handles Notion’s pagination via the start_cursor and has_more response fields for databases with thousands of entries. Status updates are pushed via the pages/{id} PATCH endpoint with property-level granularity. Relation fields are resolved by cross-referencing linked databases through the /databases/{id} GET endpoint schema. Conflict resolution uses last-write-wins with configurable merge strategies for simultaneous edits. The skill maintains a local SQLite state database for tracking sync cursors and preventing duplicate operations. Webhook support via the Notion API integration enables near-instant change detection.

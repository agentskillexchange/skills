description: "The NPM Audit Deep Scanner skill provides comprehensive JavaScript supply chain security analysis beyond standard npm audit capabilities. It queries the npm Registry API (registry.npmjs.org) to resolve complete dependency trees, identifying phantom dependencies and version conflicts invisible to standard tooling. The skill performs deep analysis of each package by querying the OSV.dev API (/v1/query) for vulnerability data across multiple ecosystems simultaneously. It identifies not just direct CVEs but also malicious package indicators by checking package metadata patterns against known typosquatting databases and the Socket.dev API for install script analysis. Automated remediation generates pull requests via the GitHub REST API v3, using the Git Trees API to create atomic commits that bump vulnerable dependencies while respecting peer dependency constraints. Each PR includes a detailed impact assessment with breaking change likelihood scores computed from semver analysis and changelog parsing. Integration with the npm diff API provides human-readable code diffs between vulnerable and patched versions for security team review."

# NPM Audit Deep Scanner

The NPM Audit Deep Scanner skill provides comprehensive JavaScript supply chain security analysis beyond standard npm audit capabilities. It queries the npm Registry API (registry.npmjs.org) to resolve complete dependency trees, identifying phantom dependencies and version conflicts invisible to standard tooling. The skill performs deep analysis of each package by querying the OSV.dev API (/v1/query) for vulnerability data across multiple ecosystems simultaneously. It identifies not just direct CVEs but also malicious package indicators by checking package metadata patterns against known typosquatting databases and the Socket.dev API for install script analysis. Automated remediation generates pull requests via the GitHub REST API v3, using the Git Trees API to create atomic commits that bump vulnerable dependencies while respecting peer dependency constraints. Each PR includes a detailed impact assessment with breaking change likelihood scores computed from semver analysis and changelog parsing. Integration with the npm diff API provides human-readable code diffs between vulnerable and patched versions for security team review.

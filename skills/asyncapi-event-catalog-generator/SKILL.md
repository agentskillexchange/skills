The skill generates event catalog pages using the asyncapi-generator with html-template and markdown-template outputs, producing navigable documentation of all published and subscribed channels. It creates JSON Schema validators for each message payload using ajv with format validation and custom keywords, generates AWS EventBridge rule templates from channel filter patterns, and produces CloudEvents envelope wrappers for standardized event metadata. The generator also creates TypeScript interfaces for message types, produces channel topology diagrams in Mermaid format, and validates spec completeness against organizational standards for required fields like contact info and message examples."

# ty Ultra-Fast Python Type Checker and Language Server

ty is an extremely fast Python type checker and language server built by Astral (the team behind Ruff and uv), written entirely in Rust for maximum performance. It provides Python developers with type checking that runs 10 to 100 times faster than established tools like mypy and Pyright, making it practical to run type checks continuously during development without disrupting workflow.

The tool delivers comprehensive diagnostics with rich contextual information, helping developers understand not just what went wrong but why. ty supports configurable rule levels, per-file overrides, and suppression comments, giving teams fine-grained control over which type errors to enforce and where. Its gradual typing support means teams can adopt ty incrementally without needing to annotate their entire codebase at once.

As a language server, ty integrates directly into code editors including VS Code, PyCharm, and Neovim. It provides code navigation, intelligent completions, code actions, auto-import suggestions, inlay hints, and on-hover documentation. The language server uses fine-grained incremental analysis designed for near-instant updates as files are edited, keeping feedback loops tight during active development.

ty includes advanced type system features such as first-class intersection types, sophisticated type narrowing, and reachability analysis based on types. It can be run standalone via the CLI with uvx ty check or integrated into CI pipelines. The tool is installable from PyPI and supports pyproject.toml configuration, fitting naturally into existing Python project structures.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**

2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

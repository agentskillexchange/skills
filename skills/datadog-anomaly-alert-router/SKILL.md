The skill queries the Datadog Monitors API v1 /api/v1/monitor/{monitor_id} endpoint to fetch full monitor configuration including thresholds, evaluation windows, and tagged scopes. Severity classification uses a three-tier model: P1 alerts trigger PagerDuty incidents via the PagerDuty Events API v2 /enqueue endpoint, P2 alerts post to team-specific Slack channels via incoming webhooks, and P3 alerts are logged to a Datadog Event stream via POST /api/v1/events. The router maintains an alert correlation engine that groups related anomalies by service tag and time window, preventing alert storms from generating duplicate pages. Includes automatic escalation: if a P2 alert remains unacknowledged for a configurable timeout (checked via Datadog /api/v1/monitor/{id}?group_states=alert), it escalates to P1.

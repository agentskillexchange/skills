# Helm Chart Diff & Upgrade Manager

Uses helm-diff to compute a human-readable diff between deployed and candidate chart versions before upgrade. Automatically bumps image tags by querying the OCI registry, then executes helm upgrade –atomic with configurable rollback timeouts. Sends upgrade status to PagerDuty or Datadog.

## Installation

Choose the method that fits your setup:

1. Clone or download this repo and copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange repo with your preferred Git workflow.
3. Add the skill folder as a git submodule if you manage skills as dependencies.
4. Copy the files manually into a local custom-skills directory for testing.
5. Use any marketplace or sync tooling you already have for pulling ASE skills.

This skill authenticates with the Slack API using a Bot OAuth token, fetches message history from configured channels within a time window, applies NLP-style extraction to identify action items (messages with ‘please’, ‘can you’, ‘need you to’ patterns plus @mentions), groups by mentioned user, and posts a formatted summary block using Block Kit. Supports DM fallback for high-priority items.
Use for async team communication management, daily standup preparation, and reducing message overload in busy engineering or ops channels. Not for real-time message processing — use Slack Events API with a webhook server for that. Not for private DMs or channels where the bot lacks membership. Requires a Slack Bot token with channels:history, chat:write, and users:read scopes.

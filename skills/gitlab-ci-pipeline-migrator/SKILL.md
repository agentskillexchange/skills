The GitLab CI Pipeline Migrator skill automates the conversion of GitLab CI/CD pipeline configurations to GitHub Actions workflow format. It uses the gitlab-ci-local parser to fully resolve .gitlab-ci.yml files including extends, anchors, and include directives.
The migration engine maps GitLab CI concepts to GitHub Actions equivalents: stages become job dependency chains with needs keywords, services become service containers, artifacts become upload/download-artifact actions, and cache configurations become actions/cache entries with matching key patterns.
YAML AST transformations preserve comments and formatting where possible, using the yaml library CST parser for structure-aware modifications. The skill handles complex GitLab features including DAG pipelines, parallel matrix jobs, rules-based conditional execution, and multi-project pipeline triggers.
Variable mapping converts GitLab CI predefined variables (CI_COMMIT_SHA, CI_PIPELINE_ID) to GitHub Actions equivalents (github.sha, github.run_id). The migrator generates a compatibility report identifying features that require manual intervention, such as GitLab-specific API integrations and container registry authentication differences.

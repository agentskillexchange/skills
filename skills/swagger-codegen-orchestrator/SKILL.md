# Swagger Codegen Orchestrator

The Swagger Codegen Orchestrator streamlines API client generation from OpenAPI 3.x specifications. It wraps swagger-codegen-cli and openapi-generator to produce strongly typed client SDKs across TypeScript, Python, and Go targets. The tool supports custom Mustache template overrides for controlling generated code style, error handling patterns, and authentication flows. It reads OpenAPI specs from local files, URLs, or directly from Swagger Hub via the SwaggerHub API. For TypeScript targets, it generates axios-based clients with full type inference and automatic retry logic using axios-retry. Python clients use httpx with async support and Pydantic v2 models for request/response validation. Go clients leverage net/http with context propagation and structured error types. The orchestrator handles multi-spec scenarios where microservices expose separate APIs, merging them into a unified SDK with proper namespace isolation and shared model deduplication.

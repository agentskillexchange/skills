# Buildkite Pipeline Profiler

The Buildkite Pipeline Profiler skill analyzes CI/CD pipeline performance on the Buildkite platform to identify and eliminate bottlenecks. It queries the Buildkite REST API v2 (/organizations/{org}/pipelines/{pipeline}/builds) and GraphQL API for detailed build step timing data, agent assignment latency, and artifact transfer metrics.

The skill profiles individual pipeline steps by analyzing the scheduled_at, started_at, and finished_at timestamps to decompose total build time into queue wait, execution, and artifact phases. It identifies slow steps using statistical analysis across recent builds, calculating p50/p95/p99 duration percentiles per step label.

Performance optimization strategies include agent queue rebalancing based on buildkite-agent meta-data tag analysis, Docker layer caching improvements using buildkite-plugins/docker-buildkite-plugin configuration, parallel step group optimization for test splitting using buildkite-plugins/test-collector-buildkite-plugin, and artifact upload/download size reduction through compression and selective path patterns.

Advanced features include dynamic pipeline generation profiling (analyzing steps uploaded via buildkite-agent pipeline upload), triggered build chain analysis across parent-child pipelines, agent fleet utilization reporting via the Agents API, and cost estimation based on step duration and agent instance types. The skill supports webhook-driven real-time alerting for builds exceeding duration thresholds.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# Microsoft Outlook Mail Sorter

The Microsoft Outlook Mail Sorter skill connects to Microsoft 365 mailboxes via the Microsoft Graph API v1.0 /me/messages endpoint with $filter and $orderby OData query parameters. It processes incoming emails by analyzing sender reputation, subject line patterns, and body content to assign categories using the /me/messages/{id} PATCH endpoint. The skill creates and manages mail folders via /me/mailFolders POST operations and moves messages using the /me/messages/{id}/move action. Custom rules are defined in a YAML configuration supporting regex patterns, sender domain matching, and keyword extraction. The skill handles pagination with @odata.nextLink for large mailboxes and supports batch requests via the $batch endpoint for processing up to 20 operations simultaneously. Delta queries using /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/delta enable efficient incremental sync without re-scanning the entire mailbox. Priority scoring weights recent sender interaction history from the People API.

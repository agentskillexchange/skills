The Helm Chart Template Scaffolder generates production-ready Helm 3 charts from application specifications. It creates properly structured templates using Go template functions from the Sprig library, including conditionals, loops, and named template definitions. Values.yaml files are generated with sensible defaults, JSON Schema validation (values.schema.json), and documented parameters. The skill produces templates for Deployments, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, ServiceAccounts, HorizontalPodAutoscalers, and PodDisruptionBudgets. Each chart includes helm-unittest test suites that verify template rendering with different value combinations. Polaris integration scores generated resources against security and reliability best practices, flagging issues like missing resource limits, running as root, or absent health checks. The skill supports Helm library charts for shared templates and handles chart dependencies with proper version constraints in Chart.yaml.

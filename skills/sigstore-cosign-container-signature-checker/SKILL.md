# Sigstore Cosign Container Signature Checker

Checks container trust with `cosign verify`, Rekor transparency log lookups, and OCI image reference inspection. Useful for agents that need to confirm whether an image was actually signed and recorded before it reaches a deployment pipeline.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

# GitHub Actions Workflow Generator

The GitHub Actions Workflow Generator skill creates production-ready CI/CD workflow files for GitHub repositories. Using the GitHub REST API v3 and the Actions-specific endpoints, it can list existing workflows, check run statuses, and programmatically dispatch workflow events. The skill generates YAML workflow definitions supporting matrix strategy builds across multiple OS versions and language runtimes. It implements reusable workflows with workflow_call triggers for organization-wide standardization. Composite actions are supported for encapsulating multi-step processes into single action references. The skill integrates actions/cache for dependency caching, actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact for build artifact management, and supports environment secrets and variables configuration. OIDC token authentication for cloud provider deployments is also supported.

# Ansible Playbook Template Library

This skill produces Ansible playbooks, roles, and inventories tailored to specific infrastructure automation needs. It queries the Ansible Galaxy API to find certified collections and community roles that match the requested automation tasks, then composes them into well-structured playbooks following Ansible best practices. The generator creates role directories with proper defaults, handlers, templates, and molecule test scenarios. It uses ansible-lint to validate generated playbooks against production rulesets, checking for deprecated modules, missing tags, and improper variable scoping. The skill supports dynamic inventory generation for AWS EC2, Azure VMs, and GCP instances using their respective inventory plugins. Vault-encrypted variable files are generated for sensitive data, and the skill produces accompanying ansible.cfg files with optimized settings for SSH pipelining, fact caching, and callback plugins.

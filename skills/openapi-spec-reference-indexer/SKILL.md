It maps authentication flows including OAuth2 authorization_code, client_credentials, and API key schemes to each endpoint based on security requirement objects. Advanced features include automatic SDK generation metadata extraction compatible with openapi-generator-cli, webhook endpoint documentation, discriminator-based polymorphism resolution, and link object traversal for API workflow documentation. The skill also detects breaking changes between spec versions by comparing path parameters, required fields, and enum values using oasdiff."

It maps authentication flows including OAuth2 authorization_code, client_credentials, and API key schemes to each endpoint based on security requirement objects. Advanced features include automatic SDK generation metadata extraction compatible with openapi-generator-cli, webhook endpoint documentation, discriminator-based polymorphism resolution, and link object traversal for API workflow documentation. The skill also detects breaking changes between spec versions by comparing path parameters, required fields, and enum values using oasdiff.

The skill supports template sourcing from local directories, Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), and zip archives. It handles nested template directories, conditional file generation using Jinja2 conditionals, and post-generation hooks for automated setup tasks like git init, virtual environment creation, and dependency installation. Advanced features include template replay from ~/.cookiecutter_replay for reproducible project creation, custom template extensions via cookiecutter extensions API, and integration with pre-commit hooks for immediate code quality enforcement. The skill validates generated project structure against configurable rules and runs post-gen test suites. Configuration supports default values via ~/.cookiecutterrc, abbreviation expansion for frequently used templates, and batch project generation from YAML manifest files."

# Bun Shell Script Executor

The Bun Shell Script Executor uses Bun’s native $ tagged template literal API (Bun.Shell) to run shell commands directly from TypeScript without spawning external processes through child_process. It composes multi-step build pipelines using Bun’s pipe operator, automatic glob expansion, and environment variable interpolation. The agent generates type-safe shell scripts that work cross-platform by leveraging Bun’s built-in implementations of common Unix utilities (cat, ls, rm, echo) that run natively on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It handles process composition with $.cwd(), $.env(), and $.throws() for error handling. Output streams are processed using Bun’s ReadableStream integration with async iterators. Particularly useful for replacing complex Makefile or npm script chains with type-checked, debuggable TypeScript that runs at near-native speed. Supports Bun.spawn() for long-running processes and Bun.file() for efficient file I/O within build pipelines.

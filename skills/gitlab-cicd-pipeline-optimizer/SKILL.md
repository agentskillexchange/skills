# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Optimizer

The GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Optimizer analyzes and improves GitLab CI/CD configurations using the .gitlab-ci.yml specification and GitLab REST API v4 (/api/v4/projects/{id}/pipelines, /jobs, /bridges). It restructures pipeline stages for maximum parallelism and minimum execution time.


The agent implements Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pipelines using the needs keyword to break sequential stage dependencies. It configures parallel keyword for test splitting, rules-based job inclusion for merge request pipelines, and extends/include for DRY configuration across projects.


Dynamic child pipelines are generated using trigger:include for monorepo workflows, with parent-child pipeline communication via dotenv artifacts. The agent optimizes Docker layer caching through kaniko builds and GitLab Container Registry integration.


Advanced features include Auto DevOps customization, review app configuration with dynamic environments, and pipeline efficiency metrics tracking. The agent monitors pipeline analytics via the API and suggests optimizations based on job duration trends, failure rates, and resource utilization patterns.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

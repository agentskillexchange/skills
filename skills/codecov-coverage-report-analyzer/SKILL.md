# Codecov Coverage Report Analyzer

The Codecov Coverage Report Analyzer skill integrates with the Codecov API v2 (api.codecov.io/api/v2) and the codecov-cli (codecovcli upload-process, codecovcli create-commit) to manage code coverage tracking across repositories. It processes coverage reports in multiple formats including lcov.info, cobertura XML, JaCoCo XML, and Clover XML.

The skill uploads coverage data using codecovcli upload-process –report-type coverage –file coverage.xml with support for flag-based coverage segmentation (–flag unit, –flag integration). It retrieves coverage analytics through the Codecov API endpoints: /repos/{owner}/{repo}/commits for commit-level coverage, /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls for PR coverage deltas, and /repos/{owner}/{repo}/flags for flag-based breakdown.

Key capabilities include codecov.yml configuration management with coverage status checks (project and patch targets), component-based coverage tracking with path-based filtering, GitHub check annotations showing uncovered lines directly in PR diffs, and Slack/Teams notification integration for coverage regressions. The analyzer supports carryforward flags for monorepo partial uploads, coverage trend visualization data extraction, and custom threshold enforcement with configurable failure conditions.

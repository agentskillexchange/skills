# Terraform Drift Detection Runbook

The Terraform Drift Detection Runbook skill uses terraform plan -detailed-exitcode to detect infrastructure drift between Terraform state files and actual cloud resources. It integrates with the Terraform Cloud API (app.terraform.io/api/v2) for workspace management and the AWS, GCP, and Azure provider APIs for resource verification. The skill executes structured drift detection workflows: terraform init with backend configuration (S3, GCS, Azure Blob), terraform plan -out=drift.plan -detailed-exitcode (exit code 2 indicates drift), and terraform show -json drift.plan for machine-readable change analysis. It parses the plan JSON to categorize changes as create, update, delete, or replace operations. Key runbook procedures include: state file analysis using terraform state list and terraform state show for resource inspection, import workflows using terraform import for unmanaged resources, targeted plans with -target for specific resource investigation, and state manipulation using terraform state mv and terraform state rm for state corrections. The runbook supports multi-workspace drift scanning via the Terraform Cloud API (GET /workspaces, POST /runs with plan-only mode), Sentinel policy check integration, and automated remediation plan generation with approval workflows.

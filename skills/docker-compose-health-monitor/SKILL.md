# Docker Compose Health Monitor

Monitors Docker Compose service health using the Docker Engine API (/containers/{id}/json) and docker-compose ps parsing. Tracks container restart counts via the RestartCount field and logs analysis through the /containers/{id}/logs endpoint.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

For clients that don&#8217;t support remote servers natively, the mcp-remote npm package provides a bridge. With 3,600+ GitHub stars and active development from the Cloudflare team, this is one of the most comprehensive MCP server suites available. It demonstrates how a platform vendor can expose their entire service surface to AI agents while maintaining proper authentication and access controls. The modular architecture — separate servers per domain — is a design pattern worth studying for anyone building MCP integrations."

# Cloudflare MCP Servers for Workers, Security, and Observability

The Cloudflare MCP Servers are a collection of official Model Context Protocol integrations maintained by Cloudflare at github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare .

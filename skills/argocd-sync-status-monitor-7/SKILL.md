title: "ArgoCD Sync Status Monitor"
description: "The ArgoCD Sync Status Monitor provides continuous oversight of GitOps deployments managed by ArgoCD. It connects to the ArgoCD server via its REST API (v1/applications) and the gRPC gateway to fetch real-time application sync and health status. The skill performs deep comparison between desired Git state and live Kubernetes cluster manifests, detecting configuration drift including resource count mismatches, spec changes, and missing finalizers. It uses the ArgoCD diff engine to generate human-readable summaries of what changed. When drift or degraded health is detected, alerts route through the Slack Bolt SDK (app.message) with structured Block Kit messages showing affected resources, sync wave details, and one-click re-sync buttons via Slack interactive components. The monitor supports multi-cluster ArgoCD installations and respects RBAC project scoping. It caches application trees using Redis to minimize API calls during high-frequency polling intervals."

# ArgoCD Sync Status Monitor

The ArgoCD Sync Status Monitor provides continuous oversight of GitOps deployments managed by ArgoCD. It connects to the ArgoCD server via its REST API (v1/applications) and the gRPC gateway to fetch real-time application sync and health status. The skill performs deep comparison between desired Git state and live Kubernetes cluster manifests, detecting configuration drift including resource count mismatches, spec changes, and missing finalizers. It uses the ArgoCD diff engine to generate human-readable summaries of what changed. When drift or degraded health is detected, alerts route through the Slack Bolt SDK (app.message) with structured Block Kit messages showing affected resources, sync wave details, and one-click re-sync buttons via Slack interactive components. The monitor supports multi-cluster ArgoCD installations and respects RBAC project scoping. It caches application trees using Redis to minimize API calls during high-frequency polling intervals.

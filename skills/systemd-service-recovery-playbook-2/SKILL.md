# Systemd Service Recovery Playbook

The Systemd Service Recovery Playbook skill automates diagnosis and recovery of failed Linux services managed by systemd. It uses systemctl, journalctl, and the systemd D-Bus API (org.freedesktop.systemd1) for comprehensive service analysis.
The diagnostic sequence: queries systemctl show for ActiveState, SubState, ExecMainStatus, and NRestarts; fetches structured journal entries via journalctl -u service -output=json for pattern matching; analyzes the dependency tree via systemctl list-dependencies -reverse; and checks cgroup resource consumption via systemd-cgtop data.
Common failure patterns handled include: exit code 137 (OOM killed) with MemoryMax/MemoryHigh cgroup limit analysis, socket activation failures with ListenStream/ListenDatagram binding issues, Type=notify services failing watchdog with WatchdogSec timeout analysis, and mount dependency failures with RequiresMountsFor resolution.
The skill generates recovery actions: systemctl reset-failed followed by conditional restart, journal-based log rotation if disk space caused failures, and dynamic property adjustment via systemctl set-property for resource limits. It handles both system and user service managers, supports drop-in override generation in /etc/systemd/system/service.d/, and creates timer-based health check units for persistent issues.

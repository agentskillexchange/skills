# Systemd Service Recovery Playbook

The Systemd Service Recovery Playbook skill automates diagnosis and recovery of failed Linux services managed by systemd. It uses systemctl, journalctl, and the systemd D-Bus API (org.freedesktop.systemd1) for comprehensive service analysis.

The diagnostic sequence: queries systemctl show for ActiveState, SubState, ExecMainStatus, and NRestarts; fetches structured journal entries via journalctl -u service –output=json for pattern matching; analyzes the dependency tree via systemctl list-dependencies –reverse; and checks cgroup resource consumption via systemd-cgtop data.

Common failure patterns handled include: exit code 137 (OOM killed) with MemoryMax/MemoryHigh cgroup limit analysis, socket activation failures with ListenStream/ListenDatagram binding issues, Type=notify services failing watchdog with WatchdogSec timeout analysis, and mount dependency failures with RequiresMountsFor resolution.

The skill generates recovery actions: systemctl reset-failed followed by conditional restart, journal-based log rotation if disk space caused failures, and dynamic property adjustment via systemctl set-property for resource limits. It handles both system and user service managers, supports drop-in override generation in /etc/systemd/system/service.d/, and creates timer-based health check units for persistent issues.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# FFmpeg Batch Transcode Pipeline

Overview
The FFmpeg Batch Transcode Pipeline orchestrates parallel video transcoding jobs with intelligent queue management and hardware acceleration detection. It maximizes throughput by distributing encoding workloads across available GPU and CPU resources while maintaining output quality standards.


Key Capabilities
This skill auto-detects hardware acceleration capabilities including NVIDIA NVENC via ffmpeg -hwaccels, Intel VAAPI through /dev/dri/renderD128, and Apple VideoToolbox on macOS. It configures optimal encoder presets with bitrate ladders for adaptive streaming, supporting both H.264 and HEVC/H.265 encoding with lookahead and B-frame optimization.


Streaming Output
Generates HLS adaptive bitrate packages using ffmpeg -f hls with multiple -map stream selections, fMP4 segment formatting for DASH compatibility, and master playlist generation with bandwidth and resolution variant declarations. Supports subtitle track multiplexing, audio normalization via the loudnorm filter, and thumbnail sprite sheet generation using the fps and tile filters for video player scrubbing previews.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

# Playwright Visual Regression Tester

Automates visual regression testing using the Playwright screenshot comparison API and pixelmatch diffing library. Captures baseline snapshots, detects pixel-level UI changes across viewport sizes, and generates HTML diff reports with threshold-based pass/fail results.


This skill integrates with production-grade tooling to streamline automation workflows. It handles edge cases such as timeout management, retry logic with exponential backoff, and detailed error reporting. Configuration is managed through environment variables and YAML config files, supporting both local development and CI/CD pipeline environments. The skill outputs structured JSON logs compatible with ELK stack and Datadog for observability. It includes built-in rate limiting to respect API quotas and implements proper credential rotation using vault-based secret management.

# GraphQL Introspection Documenter

The GraphQL Introspection Documenter connects to any GraphQL endpoint and runs the full introspection query to extract the complete type system. Using the graphql-js reference implementation, it resolves complex type hierarchies including interfaces, unions, input objects, and custom scalars. The skill generates human-readable documentation with type relationships visualized as dependency graphs. It supports schema diffing between environments (staging vs production) to catch unintended type changes. Query complexity analysis estimates the cost of operations based on field resolver depth and list cardinality annotations. The skill handles federated schemas from Apollo Federation, merging subgraph types and identifying entity boundaries. Documentation output formats include Markdown, HTML with syntax highlighting, and structured JSON suitable for import into Postman or Insomnia collections. Deprecated field tracking with sunset dates helps API consumers plan migrations.

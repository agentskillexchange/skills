The Terraform Drift Detector skill identifies configuration drift between Terraform-managed infrastructure state and actual cloud resource configurations. It runs terraform plan -detailed-exitcode to detect changes not managed by Terraform, parsing the plan output for resource additions, modifications, and deletions. The skill integrates with Terraform Cloud via the TFC API (workspaces/{id}/runs, state-versions) to access remote state, trigger speculative plans, and compare state versions over time. It supports multi-provider drift detection across AWS (using aws_instance, aws_security_group, aws_iam_role resources), GCP (google_compute_instance, google_project_iam_member), and Azure (azurerm_virtual_machine, azurerm_network_security_group). The detector generates drift reports categorized by severity—critical for security group changes, high for IAM modifications, medium for compute configuration changes—and correlates drift with CloudTrail/Audit Log events to identify the source of out-of-band changes. It supports workspace-level scanning across Terraform Cloud organizations and can trigger remediation runs.

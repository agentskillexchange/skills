It constructs resilient selectors that tolerate minor layout changes by preferring semantic attributes (data-*, aria-*, role) over positional selectors.\nKey capabilities include table-to-JSON conversion with header detection, structured data extraction from Schema.org/JSON-LD embedded markup, and form field enumeration for understanding submission requirements. The skill handles character encoding detection and conversion, relative URL resolution using Cheerio’s built-in utilities, and generates streaming extraction pipelines using htmlparser2 for memory-efficient processing of large HTML documents. Output includes typed TypeScript interfaces matching the extracted data structure."

# Cheerio DOM Scraping Toolkit

The Cheerio DOM Scraping Toolkit skill uses Cheerio, the fast and lightweight jQuery-like library for server-side HTML parsing and manipulation. Unlike browser-based scraping, Cheerio operates on raw HTML strings without a DOM environment, making it significantly faster for static page extraction tasks.
The skill generates extraction code using Cheerio’s CSS selector engine, supporting complex selectors including attribute selectors, pseudo-classes (:nth-child, :contains, :has), and combinators. It constructs resilient selectors that tolerate minor layout changes by preferring semantic attributes (data-*, aria-*, role) over positional selectors.
Key capabilities include table-to-JSON conversion with header detection, structured data extraction from Schema.org/JSON-LD embedded markup, and form field enumeration for understanding submission requirements. The skill handles character encoding detection and conversion, relative URL resolution using Cheerio’s built-in utilities, and generates streaming extraction pipelines using htmlparser2 for memory-efficient processing of large HTML documents. Output includes typed TypeScript interfaces matching the extracted data structure.

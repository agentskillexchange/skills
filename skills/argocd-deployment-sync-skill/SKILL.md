# ArgoCD Deployment Sync Skill

Manages GitOps deployments via the ArgoCD REST API and argocd CLI. Triggers application syncs through /api/v1/applications/{name}/sync, monitors health status via /api/v1/applications/{name}, and manages rollbacks using /api/v1/applications/{name}/rollback for Kubernetes workloads.

## Installation

Choose the setup path that fits your environment:

1. Clone or download this skill into your local skills workspace.
2. Install it with ClawHub if it is available there.
3. Copy the folder into your OpenClaw or AgentSkills directory manually.
4. Add it as a git submodule if you manage skills as pinned dependencies.
5. Vendor it directly into a project repo when you need a fixed internal copy.

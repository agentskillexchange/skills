The ArgoCD Deployment Sync Skill provides GitOps-based continuous deployment management for Kubernetes clusters through the ArgoCD REST API. It handles application lifecycle management from creation through sync, health monitoring, and rollback.
Application management uses the /api/v1/applications endpoint for CRUD operations. The agent creates Application resources with configurable source repositories, target clusters, sync policies, and Helm/Kustomize parameter overrides. It supports ApplicationSets for multi-cluster and multi-tenant deployments using generators (list, cluster, git, matrix).
Sync operations are triggered via /api/v1/applications/{name}/sync with options for selective resource syncing, dry-run preview, prune control, and sync strategy (apply vs hook). The skill monitors sync progress through server-sent events at /api/v1/stream/applications, tracking resource-level sync and health status in real time.
Health monitoring queries /api/v1/applications/{name} for aggregate and per-resource health status (Healthy, Progressing, Degraded, Missing). The agent implements automated remediation workflows including sync retries, resource deletion for stuck resources, and automated rollback via /api/v1/applications/{name}/rollback when health checks fail.
Additional features include diff preview between desired and live state, RBAC project management through /api/v1/projects, repository credential management, and notification integration via ArgoCD Notifications for Slack/webhook alerts on sync events.

title: "ImageMagick Batch Processor"
description: "The ImageMagick Batch Processor automates large-scale image transformations using ImageMagick&#8217;s CLI tools (convert, mogrify, identify) and the MagickWand API. It handles batch operations including resize with aspect ratio preservation (-geometry), smart cropping (-gravity center -crop), watermark overlay (-composite), and format conversion between JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, and TIFF. The skill leverages libvips integration for high-throughput thumbnail generation, achieving 5-10x faster processing compared to pure ImageMagick for resize operations. It supports ICC color profile management (-profile sRGB.icc), EXIF metadata preservation and stripping (-strip), and progressive JPEG encoding (-interlace Plane) for web optimization. Advanced features include batch rename with template patterns, directory watching for automated processing of new uploads, quality optimization using perceptual metrics (SSIM scoring via -compare), and parallel processing across CPU cores. Output includes processing reports with file size reduction statistics, dimension changes, and format conversion summaries."

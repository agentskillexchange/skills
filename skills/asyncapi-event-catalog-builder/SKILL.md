# AsyncAPI Event Catalog Builder

The AsyncAPI Event Catalog Builder parses AsyncAPI 3.0 specification files to generate comprehensive event-driven architecture documentation. Using the official @asyncapi/parser library, it extracts channel definitions, message payload schemas (JSON Schema and Avro), server bindings, and operation traits. The skill generates catalog pages for each event type showing producers, consumers, schema evolution history, and payload examples. Kafka-specific bindings are resolved to show topic configurations, partition key strategies, and consumer group assignments. RabbitMQ bindings map exchanges, routing keys, and queue configurations. The skill supports schema registry integration for Confluent Schema Registry and AWS Glue, tracking schema compatibility levels (BACKWARD, FORWARD, FULL). Cross-reference analysis identifies event chains and saga patterns across multiple AsyncAPI specs. Output includes an interactive HTML catalog with search, filtering by domain, and dependency visualization between services.

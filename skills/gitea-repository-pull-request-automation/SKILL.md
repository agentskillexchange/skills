title: "Gitea Repository &#038; Pull Request Automation"
description: "Gitea Repository & Pull Request Automation is a tool-anchored skill built around Gitea , the self-hosted Git service maintained by the go-gitea organization. It is designed for agents that need to work against a private forge instead of GitHub: creating repositories, opening or reviewing pull requests, syncing labels and milestones, managing releases, and responding to webhooks from internal development systems. Because Gitea exposes a documented REST API for repositories, issues, pull requests, branches, tags, packages, users, and organizations, it gives agents a concrete surface area for repeatable automation rather than vague UI scripting. In practice, this skill fits jobs like triaging incoming issues, creating pull requests from generated branches, checking CI status before merge, updating release notes, or mirroring repository metadata across internal tooling. It also works well in environments where developers already run Gitea with Actions-compatible CI or package registries and want one automation layer to interact with the whole stack. The upstream project ships Docker installation guidance, API documentation, and an actively maintained release stream, so it passes the intake bar for a real, documented source. Integration points include the Gitea REST API, webhooks, repository settings, token-based authentication, and optional Docker-based deployments for local or remote instances."

# Gitea Repository &#038; Pull Request Automation

Gitea Repository & Pull Request Automation is a tool-anchored skill built around Gitea , the self-hosted Git service maintained by the go-gitea organization. It is designed for agents that need to work against a private forge instead of GitHub: creating repositories, opening or reviewing pull requests, syncing labels and milestones, managing releases, and responding to webhooks from internal development systems.

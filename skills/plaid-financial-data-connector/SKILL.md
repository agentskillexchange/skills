# Plaid Financial Data Connector

Connects to bank accounts via Plaid Link SDK and retrieves transaction data using the Plaid Transactions API. Supports account balance polling, institution search, and webhook-driven sync.

This skill automates plaid financial data connector operations for agent-driven workflows. It wraps the underlying API client libraries with sensible defaults for authentication, error handling, and pagination. Configuration is managed through environment variables and a local settings file, keeping credentials out of your codebase. The agent validates inputs against the provider’s API schema before making requests, catching configuration errors early. Includes retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures and structured logging for audit trails. Works in both synchronous command mode and event-driven webhook mode for real-time integrations.

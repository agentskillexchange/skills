title: "Airbyte Connector Config Generator"
description: "The Airbyte Connector Config Generator automates the creation of source and destination connector configurations for the Airbyte data integration platform. It uses the Airbyte API /v1/source_definitions/get_for_workspace endpoint to fetch available connector specifications and generates valid configuration JSON based on the connector spec schema. The generator validates configurations against the Airbyte Protocol specification, ensuring proper authentication credentials, sync mode settings, and stream selections. It supports the /v1/sources/create and /v1/destinations/create API endpoints for programmatic connector provisioning. Connection testing is automated via the /v1/sources/check_connection endpoint to verify credentials and network connectivity before deployment. The skill generates complete sync configurations including namespace mapping, cursor field selection for incremental syncs, and primary key definitions for deduplication. It also produces Airbyte Terraform provider configurations for infrastructure-as-code deployments."

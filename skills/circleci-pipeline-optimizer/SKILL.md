# CircleCI Pipeline Optimizer

The CircleCI Pipeline Optimizer connects to the CircleCI API v2 to analyze pipeline performance and identify optimization opportunities. It queries /pipeline/{pipeline-id}/workflow to map workflow structures, then fetches job details via /workflow/{id}/job to extract timing breakdowns for each step. The agent identifies bottlenecks by comparing step durations across recent runs and flagging jobs that consistently exceed expected execution times. It analyzes Docker image pull times and recommends Docker Layer Caching (DLC) for custom images, calculates optimal parallelism values based on test splitting data from circleci tests split, and suggests resource class upgrades where CPU/memory constraints cause slowdowns. The optimizer generates updated .circleci/config.yml configurations with proper orb references, workspace persistence for artifact sharing between jobs, and conditional workflow execution using pipeline parameters and when/unless clauses. It also evaluates cache hit rates and recommends key rotation strategies.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

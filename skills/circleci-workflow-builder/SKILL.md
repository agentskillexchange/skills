# CircleCI Workflow Builder

The CircleCI Workflow Builder skill automates the creation and optimization of CircleCI configuration files. It uses the CircleCI Orbs SDK to compose reusable configuration packages for common build patterns including Node.js, Python, Go, and Rust projects. The skill leverages the CircleCI Workflows API to design complex workflow graphs with fan-out/fan-in patterns, conditional execution using pipeline parameters, and scheduled triggers via cron expressions. Test splitting is optimized through the CircleCI Test Splitting API, distributing test suites across parallel containers based on timing data from previous runs. The skill configures appropriate resource classes for each job, balancing cost against build speed. It supports Docker layer caching, workspace persistence between jobs, and matrix job generation for cross-platform testing. Advanced features include dynamic configuration using setup workflows, custom orb development, and integration with CircleCI Insights API for build performance analytics.

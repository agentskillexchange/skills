# Cookiecutter Project Bootstrapper

This skill automates project scaffolding using the Cookiecutter templating engine with Jinja2 variable interpolation. It resolves templates from GitHub repositories, local directories, or custom template registries, processing cookiecutter.json context files for interactive or automated variable substitution. The agent handles nested template directories with conditional file inclusion based on feature flags. Post-generation hooks execute shell scripts for dependency installation, git initialization, and IDE configuration. Pre-generation hooks validate input parameters against custom rules and external API checks. The skill supports Cookiecutter extensions for custom Jinja2 filters and tags, enabling complex string transformations and UUID generation. Template composition allows layering multiple templates for framework-specific customization on top of base project structures. Version pinning ensures reproducible scaffolding across team members. The bootstrapper generates editorconfig, gitignore, and CI pipeline files appropriate for the detected language and framework stack.

# Apache Kafka Stream Transformer

The Apache Kafka Stream Transformer provides real-time event processing capabilities using KafkaJS as the client library. It connects to Kafka clusters as a consumer group member, processes messages through configurable transformation pipelines, and produces enriched output to downstream topics.

Core functionality includes consumer group management with kafka.consumer({ groupId }), topic subscription with pattern matching, and manual offset management via consumer.commitOffsets(). The skill handles partition rebalancing events through the GROUP_JOIN and REBALANCING instrumentation events.

Message transformation supports Avro schema deserialization via Schema Registry integration (@kafkajs/confluent-schema-registry), field mapping, filtering, and enrichment from external sources. Failed transformations are routed to configurable dead-letter queues with original message metadata preserved. The agent monitors consumer lag via admin client admin.fetchOffsets() and provides alerting when lag exceeds thresholds. Supports exactly-once semantics with transactional producers.

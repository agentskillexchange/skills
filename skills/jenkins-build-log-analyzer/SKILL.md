# Jenkins Build Log Analyzer

This skill connects to a Jenkins instance using its Remote Access API (/api/json endpoints) with username/API-token authentication. It fetches the last N build console logs for a given job using the /logText/progressiveText endpoint and applies regex pattern matching to extract Java stack traces, Maven Surefire test failures, and Docker build errors. The Jenkins Test Report API (/testReport/api/json) is queried to identify test methods with high flakiness scores. Results are grouped by failure category (environment, test, build tool) and ranked by occurrence count across the time window. The skill also integrates with the Jenkins Change Sets API to correlate failures with specific committer emails, enabling targeted developer notifications. Output is a structured Markdown triage report with suggested next steps.

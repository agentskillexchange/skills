title: "Kubernetes Events API CrashLoop Investigator"
description: "Kubernetes Events API CrashLoop Investigator is designed for operational debugging when a deployment or job keeps restarting and nobody wants to assemble the evidence from scratch every time. It works with the Kubernetes Events API, Pod status and container state fields, and cluster metrics from the Metrics API to show what happened, when it started, and which signals matter most. That makes it well suited for CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, failed readiness checks, and other noisy pod failure modes.\nThe skill can correlate event timelines with restart counts, last termination reasons, node placement, and recent resource pressure. In practice, that gives responders a more reliable first-pass explanation than reading a single event stream in isolation. It also helps agents produce summaries that point toward configuration, dependency, or resource causes instead of generic statements like “pod is unhealthy.”\nUse this skill when you want cluster diagnostics that stay grounded in native Kubernetes APIs and when on-call engineers need a faster, cleaner view of repeated pod startup failures."

# Kubernetes Events API CrashLoop Investigator

Kubernetes Events API CrashLoop Investigator is designed for operational debugging when a deployment or job keeps restarting and nobody wants to assemble the evidence from scratch every time. It works with the Kubernetes Events API, Pod status and container state fields, and cluster metrics from the Metrics API to show what happened, when it started, and which signals matter most. That makes it well suited for CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, failed readiness checks, and other noisy pod failure modes.
The skill can correlate event timelines with restart counts, last termination reasons, node placement, and recent resource pressure. In practice, that gives responders a more reliable first-pass explanation than reading a single event stream in isolation. It also helps agents produce summaries that point toward configuration, dependency, or resource causes instead of generic statements like “pod is unhealthy.”
Use this skill when you want cluster diagnostics that stay grounded in native Kubernetes APIs and when on-call engineers need a faster, cleaner view of repeated pod startup failures.

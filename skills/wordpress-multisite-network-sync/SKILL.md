# WordPress Multisite Network Sync

Synchronizes plugin settings and theme mods across a WordPress Multisite network using the Network Admin REST endpoints and wp_get_sites() iteration. Propagates sitewide options, user role caps, and widget configurations from a primary site to subsites.

This skill automates the tedious task of keeping multisite subsites in sync with a primary configuration. It iterates over all active subsites, compares settings for target plugins, and applies updates via switch_to_blog()/update_option() through WP-CLI or direct REST. Supports allowlist/denylist for which options to propagate and dry-run mode for preview. Generates a diff report before applying changes.
Ideal for agency workflows managing 10+ subsites with shared plugin configurations, theme settings, or user role structures. Not for syncing post content between sites — use the WP Replicator pattern for content. Requires Super Admin credentials and WP Multisite configured with subdirectory or subdomain mode.

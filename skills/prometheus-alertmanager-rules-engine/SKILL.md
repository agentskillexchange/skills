# Prometheus AlertManager Rules Engine

The Prometheus AlertManager Rules Engine skill creates comprehensive alerting configurations for Prometheus monitoring stacks. It queries the Prometheus HTTP API to analyze existing metric names, label cardinality, and recording rules before generating PromQL alert expressions with appropriate thresholds and for-durations. The skill generates AlertManager routing trees with receiver configurations for Slack, PagerDuty, and email notification channels, implementing proper grouping with group_by labels and group_wait/group_interval timing. It configures inhibition rules to suppress downstream alerts when upstream dependencies are already alerting, manages silence windows through the AlertManager Silence API for planned maintenance, and validates all generated rules using the promtool check rules command syntax. The engine analyzes historical alert firing patterns via the Prometheus Alerts API to recommend threshold adjustments that reduce alert fatigue while maintaining coverage for genuine incidents.

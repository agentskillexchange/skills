The Buildkite Agent Monitor skill provides real-time visibility into your Buildkite CI infrastructure by querying the Buildkite REST API v3 and GraphQL API endpoints. It tracks agent pool health including connectivity status, queue depth trends, and job wait time percentiles.
The skill polls the /v2/organizations/{org}/agents endpoint to detect agents that have gone offline or become unresponsive, comparing last-seen timestamps against configurable thresholds. Queue depth monitoring queries the GraphQL pipeline.jobs connection to compute real-time backlog sizes per queue name, triggering alerts when depth exceeds configured limits.
Job wait time analysis uses the Buildkite Builds API to compute p50, p95, and p99 wait times over sliding windows. When any metric crosses threshold, the skill formats detailed alert messages and dispatches them via the Slack Web API chat.postMessage method, including direct links to the Buildkite dashboard. Historical metrics are stored locally for trend analysis, enabling the agent to identify recurring bottlenecks in specific queues or time windows.

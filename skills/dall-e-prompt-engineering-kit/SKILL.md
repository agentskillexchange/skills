# DALL-E Prompt Engineering Kit

The DALL-E Prompt Engineering Kit provides systematic prompt construction for OpenAI’s image generation API. It interfaces with the /v1/images/generations endpoint using structured prompt templates that combine subject descriptions, style modifiers (photorealistic, digital art, watercolor, isometric), lighting directives, and composition guidelines.

The skill manages DALL-E 3 specific parameters including quality presets (standard vs hd), size options (1024×1024, 1792×1024, 1024×1792), and the revised_prompt response field for understanding how prompts are interpreted. It implements prompt chaining for iterative refinement, where generation results inform subsequent prompt adjustments.

Advanced features include negative prompt patterns (specifying what to exclude), style consistency tokens for maintaining visual coherence across series, batch variation generation using seed manipulation, and A/B prompt testing with visual similarity scoring. The kit includes prompt libraries for common use cases (product photography, character design, architectural visualization, icon generation) and integrates with the Images Edit endpoint for inpainting and outpainting workflows. Cost tracking per generation and rate limit management with queuing are built in.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

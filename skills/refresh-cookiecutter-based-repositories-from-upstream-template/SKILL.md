# Refresh Cookiecutter-based repositories from their upstream template without losing local answers

Use Cruft when an agent needs to pull new changes from a Cookiecutter template into an existing generated repository without redoing the project from scratch. The agent tracks the template origin, previews the diff, applies the update, and preserves the repository&#8217;s saved answers and local customizations as carefully as possible.

# Jenkins Pipeline Debugger

The Jenkins Pipeline Debugger skill provides deep inspection of Jenkins CI pipelines through the Jenkins REST API and Blue Ocean REST endpoints. It fetches pipeline run details from /blue/rest/organizations/{org}/pipelines/{name}/runs/{id}/nodes/ to map stage execution graphs. Failed stage logs are retrieved via the consoleText API and parsed for common error patterns including dependency resolution failures, Docker image pull errors, and credential binding issues. The skill can replay failed builds using the POST /job/{name}/{id}/replay endpoint with modified Groovy scripts. It inspects the CPS (Continuation Passing Style) execution state through the Pipeline Steps API to identify where Groovy closures stalled. Shared library resolution is traced using the Global Library configuration API. Build queue analysis via /queue/api/json identifies executor starvation and label mismatch bottlenecks.

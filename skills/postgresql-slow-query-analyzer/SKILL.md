# PostgreSQL Slow Query Analyzer

Queries pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_activity to surface the top slow queries by total execution time, mean latency, and call frequency. Runs EXPLAIN ANALYZE on worst offenders and suggests index additions, rewrite candidates, or vacuum triggers. Works on RDS and Supabase.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

# ESLint Auto-Fixer

The ESLint Auto-Fixer skill leverages the ESLint Node.js API to programmatically lint and fix JavaScript and TypeScript files. It supports the new flat config format (eslint.config.js) and legacy .eslintrc configurations.

The skill loads project-specific ESLint configurations, including plugins like typescript-eslint, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-import, and eslint-plugin-prettier. It applies automatic fixes using the fix option in the ESLint API, tracking which rules were applied and which required manual intervention.

Output is available in multiple formats including stylish console output, JSON, and SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) for integration with GitHub Code Scanning. The skill handles monorepo configurations with separate configs per package. It supports custom rule overrides via command parameters and can operate in dry-run mode to preview changes before applying them. Particularly useful for enforcing consistent code style across large codebases.

Overview
The Podcast RSS Feed Audio Normalizer ensures consistent listening experiences across podcast episodes by standardizing audio loudness levels to broadcast specifications. It processes episodes from RSS feeds and re-uploads normalized audio to podcast hosting platforms automatically.
Key Capabilities
This skill parses podcast RSS feeds using Python’s feedparser library to discover and download episode audio files. It applies the FFmpeg loudnorm filter in dual-pass mode for EBU R128 compliant loudness normalization, targeting -16 LUFS for podcast distribution with -1 dBTP true peak limiting to prevent clipping on consumer devices.
Platform Integration
Integrates with the Podbean API and Buzzsprout API for automated episode re-upload after normalization, preserving original metadata including episode titles, descriptions, chapter markers, and artwork. Supports batch processing of back-catalog episodes with parallel download and encoding queues, and generates before/after loudness comparison reports using ffmpeg astats filter measurements for quality verification.

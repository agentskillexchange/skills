# PagerDuty Incident Runbook

The PagerDuty Incident Runbook agent integrates with PagerDuty via the Events API v2 and REST API (/incidents, /services, /escalation_policies) to automate incident response workflows. When triggered by a PagerDuty webhook, it identifies the affected service and matches it to a pre-configured diagnostic runbook. The agent executes runbook steps sequentially: gathering system metrics, checking service health endpoints, querying log aggregation APIs (Elasticsearch, Datadog), and running connectivity tests. Each step’s output is captured and posted as a timeline note on the PagerDuty incident via POST /incidents/{id}/notes. For known failure patterns, the agent can escalate to automated remediation: restarting services via SSH, scaling infrastructure through cloud provider APIs, or toggling feature flags. It respects escalation policies and notifies on-call engineers when automated remediation fails. Supports custom severity mappings, maintenance window awareness, and integration with Statuspage for public communication during outages.

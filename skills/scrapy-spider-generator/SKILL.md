# Scrapy Spider Generator

The Scrapy Spider Generator creates production-grade web scraping spiders using the Scrapy framework. It generates Spider classes with properly configured start_urls, parse methods, and Item definitions with Field declarations and ItemLoader processors.


The agent builds comprehensive Scrapy projects with settings.py configuration for CONCURRENT_REQUESTS, DOWNLOAD_DELAY, and AUTOTHROTTLE settings. It generates custom Downloader Middleware for request fingerprinting, proxy rotation via scrapy-rotating-proxies, and user-agent randomization using scrapy-fake-useragent.


Key features include CrawlSpider generation with Rule and LinkExtractor definitions for automated link following, SitemapSpider configuration for XML sitemap-based crawling, and Feed Export setup for JSON Lines, CSV, and direct database output via scrapy-djangoitem. The agent also configures Item Pipelines for data validation, deduplication using scrapy-deltafetch, and export to Elasticsearch, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL. Supports Splash integration for JavaScript-rendered content via scrapy-splash middleware.

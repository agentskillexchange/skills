# SSL Certificate Chain Validator

End-to-end SSL/TLS certificate chain validation agent that verifies the complete trust chain from leaf certificate through intermediates to root CA. Uses OpenSSL s_client for handshake analysis and certificate extraction. Queries Certificate Transparency logs via the crt.sh API to detect unauthorized certificate issuance. Checks Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responders and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for revocation status. Monitors certificate expiration with configurable warning thresholds at 30, 14, and 7 days. Validates Subject Alternative Names (SANs) against expected domains. Tests cipher suite strength and protocol version support including TLS 1.3 compliance. Generates compliance reports for PCI DSS and SOC 2 certificate requirements. Supports bulk scanning of domain lists with concurrent validation.

# GitLab CI Pipeline Cost Calculator

The GitLab CI Pipeline Cost Calculator skill provides detailed cost analysis for your GitLab CI/CD pipelines by tracking compute minute consumption across projects, groups, and runner types. It queries the GitLab REST API v4 pipelines and jobs endpoints to collect execution duration data for every pipeline run.
The calculator differentiates between shared runners, group runners, and project-specific runners, applying the correct cost multiplier for each runner type based on GitLab's compute minute pricing model. Linux, Windows, and macOS runners are tracked separately with their respective cost factors (1x, 2x, and 6x respectively).
For each pipeline, the skill breaks down costs by individual job, identifying the most expensive stages and jobs. It tracks trends over time, showing cost per pipeline, cost per merge request, and daily/weekly/monthly spend aggregations. The analyzer flags jobs that consistently exceed expected durations and recommends caching strategies, artifact optimization, and job parallelization to reduce costs.
Additional features include budget threshold alerting, cost allocation by team or project label, comparison of self-hosted vs shared runner economics, and ROI calculations for proposed pipeline optimizations. The skill generates exportable CSV reports for finance team review and supports GitLab.com, self-managed, and dedicated instances.

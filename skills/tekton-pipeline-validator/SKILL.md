It integrates with the Kubernetes ValidatingAdmissionWebhook to simulate real cluster admission checks.
Key features include recursive directory scanning for multi-file pipelines, cross-resource reference validation (ensuring Tasks referenced by Pipelines actually exist), and detailed error reporting with line numbers. The validator supports both Tekton Pipelines v1beta1 and v1 API versions, automatically detecting the schema version from resource apiVersion fields.

# PagerDuty Incident Runbook Linker

The PagerDuty Incident Runbook Linker bridges the gap between alerting and response by automatically associating PagerDuty incidents with relevant operational runbooks. It uses the PagerDuty REST API v2 to monitor incident creation events and extract service context, alert descriptions, and urgency levels. Runbook matching uses Elasticsearch fuzzy queries against a runbook index built from Confluence, Notion, or Markdown documentation repositories. The skill maintains a mapping between PagerDuty services, escalation policies, and runbook collections. When an incident fires, it posts the top-matched runbook links as incident notes and updates the incident custom fields with runbook metadata. Integration with the PagerDuty Events API v2 allows enriching alerts with runbook links before they create incidents. The skill tracks runbook effectiveness by correlating MTTR with runbook usage, identifying which runbooks lead to fastest resolution times and which need updating.

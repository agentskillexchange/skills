It handles the complete payment lifecycle from customer creation to subscription management and dispute handling. Core payment flows include creating PaymentIntents with stripe.paymentIntents.create() for one-time charges, setting up recurring billing with stripe.subscriptions.create() and price objects, and processing refunds via stripe.refunds.create(). The skill supports multiple payment methods including cards, ACH direct debit, SEPA, and Apple/Google Pay through the Payment Element. Webhook processing is handled securely using stripe.webhooks.constructEvent() with signature verification. The agent listens for critical events including payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_failed, customer.subscription.updated, and charge.dispute.created, routing each to appropriate handler functions. For marketplace scenarios, the skill supports Stripe Connect with Standard, Express, and Custom account types. It manages account onboarding via Account Links, creates transfers with stripe.transfers.create(), and handles destination charges for platform fee collection. Additional features include metered billing via usage records, coupon/promotion code management, and tax calculation with Stripe Tax."

# Cookiecutter Project Template Engine

The Cookiecutter Project Template Engine provides intelligent management of Cookiecutter project templates with advanced Jinja2 templating capabilities. It handles dynamic variable substitution, conditional file generation based on user choices, and complex post-generation hook scripts written in Python or shell. The engine supports template inheritance chains where child templates can extend parent templates, reducing duplication across similar project types. Integration with cruft enables tracking of template updates so existing projects can be diffed and updated when the upstream template changes. The tool includes a template registry for organizing and discovering templates across your organization. It validates cookiecutter.json configurations, checks for common template errors like missing variables or circular dependencies, and supports private Git repositories as template sources via SSH or token authentication. Batch instantiation allows generating multiple projects from different templates in a single operation.

# Validate CI and app config files against upstream JSON schemas before merge

Use check-jsonschema when an agent needs to catch broken GitHub Actions, Renovate, Azure Pipelines, and other schema-backed config files before they hit CI. The agent picks the right schema hook, validates the changed files, and reports the exact key or structure that drifted from the contract.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

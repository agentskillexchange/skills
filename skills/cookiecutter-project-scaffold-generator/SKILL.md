description: "The Cookiecutter Project Scaffold Generator skill automates new project creation using the Cookiecutter templating system with Jinja2-based variable interpolation. It manages a curated library of project templates for Python packages, FastAPI services, React applications, CLI tools, and microservice architectures. The skill handles interactive and non-interactive template rendering, supporting cookiecutter.json defaults, choice variables, and conditional file/directory inclusion based on user selections. Post-generation hooks execute setup tasks like git initialization, virtual environment creation, dependency installation, and CI/CD pipeline configuration. Template composition allows combining multiple template fragments (testing setup, Docker configuration, documentation scaffolding) into a unified project structure. The skill validates generated projects by running linters, type checkers, and test suites immediately after scaffolding to ensure templates produce working codebases."

description: "The Markdown-to-AMP Article Converter transforms standard Markdown content into fully compliant Accelerated Mobile Pages using the unified.js ecosystem. It processes Markdown through remark-parse, applies remark-gfm for GitHub Flavored Markdown support, then converts to HTML via remark-rehype. AMP-specific transformations include replacing img tags with amp-img components (with automatic width/height detection via probe-image-size), converting embedded videos to amp-video or amp-youtube, and injecting the required AMP boilerplate. The rehype-sanitize plugin strips non-compliant HTML while preserving semantic structure. Schema.org structured data is generated using the schema-dts TypeScript library, producing Article, NewsArticle, or BlogPosting markup based on frontmatter metadata. Every output is validated against Google&#8217;s amphtml-validator library before writing. The skill supports custom AMP components injection, Open Graph meta tags, canonical URL management, and sitemap.xml generation for batches of converted articles. CSS is inlined and minified to meet AMP&#8217;s 75KB limit using cssnano."

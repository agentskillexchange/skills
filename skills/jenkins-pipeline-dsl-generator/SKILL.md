# Jenkins Pipeline DSL Generator

The Jenkins Pipeline DSL Generator skill automates the creation of Jenkins pipeline configurations in both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax. It communicates with Jenkins instances via the Jenkins REST API to discover available plugins, credentials, and agent labels.

The skill generates Jenkinsfile content with proper stage definitions, parallel execution blocks, and post-build actions. It integrates with the Jenkins Shared Library mechanism to produce reusable Groovy functions under vars/ and src/ directories, following the standard Jenkins library structure.

Key features include automatic credential binding using withCredentials blocks for secrets stored in the Jenkins Credentials Provider, Docker agent configuration with custom Dockerfile builds, and matrix builds using the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin. The skill validates pipeline syntax using the Jenkins Pipeline Linter API endpoint and suggests optimizations for build caching with stash/unstash patterns.

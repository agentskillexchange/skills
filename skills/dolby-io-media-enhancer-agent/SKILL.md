# Dolby.io Media Enhancer

Dolby.io Media Enhancer leverages Dolby's cloud-based media processing APIs to improve audio and video quality programmatically. It uses the /media/enhance REST endpoint with Bearer token authentication to submit media files for processing.
For audio enhancement, the agent configures noise reduction with noise.reduction.amount: high, speech isolation, loudness normalization to EBU R128 (-23 LUFS) or ATSC A/85 standards, and dynamic range compression. It supports input formats including WAV, MP3, AAC, and OGG via presigned URL upload to Dolby's /media/input endpoint.
Video enhancement includes automatic content-aware upscaling, color correction, and bandwidth optimization. The agent polls job status via /media/enhance?job_id={id} with configurable intervals and retrieves processed output from /media/output. Supports webhook callbacks for async pipeline integration. Includes batch processing mode for multiple files with job queuing and priority management.

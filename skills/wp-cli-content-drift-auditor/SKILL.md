# WP-CLI Content Drift Auditor

Audits WordPress content drift by comparing live posts, revisions, and key options using WP-CLI commands like `wp post list`, `wp post meta get`, and `wp option get`. Useful for catching accidental edits, stale templates, and mismatches between REST output and database state before they turn into site-wide regressions.

## Installation

Choose the method that fits your setup:

1. Clone or download this repo and copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange repo with your preferred Git workflow.
3. Add the skill folder as a git submodule if you manage skills as dependencies.
4. Copy the files manually into a local custom-skills directory for testing.
5. Use any marketplace or sync tooling you already have for pulling ASE skills.

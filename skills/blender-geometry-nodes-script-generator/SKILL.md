# Blender Geometry Nodes Script Generator

The Blender Geometry Nodes Script Generator creates Python scripts using Blender’s bpy.data.node_groups API to programmatically build Geometry Nodes modifier stacks. It translates natural language descriptions of parametric 3D operations into node tree configurations including Mesh Primitives, Curve operations, Instance on Points, Attribute nodes, and Math operations. The agent generates scripts compatible with Blender 4.x’s GeometryNodeTree interface, handling socket connections via node_tree.links.new(), group inputs/outputs through the new panel-based interface, and custom attribute domains (POINT, FACE, CORNER, CURVE, INSTANCE). Scripts can be run headless via blender –background –python for batch asset generation in CI/CD pipelines. Supports common procedural workflows: scatter systems, boolean operations, mesh deformation, curve-to-mesh pipes, and volume-based erosion. Output scripts include proper node positioning with node.location tuples for readable graph layouts.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

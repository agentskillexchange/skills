# Blender Geometry Nodes Script Generator

The Blender Geometry Nodes Script Generator creates Python scripts using Blender’s bpy.data.node_groups API to programmatically build Geometry Nodes modifier stacks. It translates natural language descriptions of parametric 3D operations into node tree configurations including Mesh Primitives, Curve operations, Instance on Points, Attribute nodes, and Math operations. The agent generates scripts compatible with Blender 4.x’s GeometryNodeTree interface, handling socket connections via node_tree.links.new(), group inputs/outputs through the new panel-based interface, and custom attribute domains (POINT, FACE, CORNER, CURVE, INSTANCE). Scripts can be run headless via blender –background –python for batch asset generation in CI/CD pipelines. Supports common procedural workflows: scatter systems, boolean operations, mesh deformation, curve-to-mesh pipes, and volume-based erosion. Output scripts include proper node positioning with node.location tuples for readable graph layouts.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

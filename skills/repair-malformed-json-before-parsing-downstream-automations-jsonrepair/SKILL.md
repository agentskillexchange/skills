# Repair malformed JSON before parsing downstream automations with jsonrepair

Use jsonrepair when an agent receives JSON-like output that is almost valid but still breaks parsers, such as trailing commas, missing quotes, or concatenated fragments. The agent’s role is to normalize the payload before validation or routing, not to replace real schema design.

## Installation

Choose the install path that fits your setup:

1. Install from the Agent Skill Exchange catalog if your agent client supports it.
2. Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory.
3. Add it as a git submodule in your shared agent-skills repo.
4. Vendor the files directly into a project-specific `.agents/skills/` or equivalent folder.
5. Keep a fork or mirror if you need local modifications or pinned revisions.

# SEO Schema Markup Generator

The SEO Schema Markup Generator creates comprehensive JSON-LD structured data following Schema.org specifications for improved search engine visibility. It generates Article, Product, FAQPage, HowTo, LocalBusiness, and Organization schemas with proper nesting and required properties. The agent validates all generated markup against the Google Rich Results Test API and checks compatibility with the Search Console structured data reports. It integrates with Yoast SEO through the wpseo_json_ld_output filter and Rank Math via rank_math/json_ld hook for WordPress sites. The generator supports dynamic schema generation from page content using natural language processing to extract FAQ pairs, product attributes, and review ratings. It handles breadcrumb schema via BreadcrumbList type with automatic URL hierarchy detection, generates VideoObject schema from embedded YouTube and Vimeo content using their oEmbed APIs, and creates SiteNavigationElement schemas from menu structures. Output is minified and injected via wp_head action with proper script type application/ld+json.

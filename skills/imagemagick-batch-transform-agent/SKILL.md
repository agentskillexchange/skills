# ImageMagick Batch Transform Agent

The ImageMagick Batch Transform Agent orchestrates complex image manipulation workflows using ImageMagick 7 command-line tools (magick convert, mogrify, composite). It generates responsive image srcsets with configurable breakpoints, outputting WebP, AVIF, and JPEG fallbacks with optimal quality settings determined by SSIM perceptual analysis.

Color management leverages Little CMS (LCMS2) for ICC profile conversions between sRGB, Adobe RGB, and CMYK color spaces, ensuring print-ready output. The skill handles EXIF metadata preservation or stripping based on privacy requirements, auto-orients images from camera rotation tags, and applies smart cropping using entropy-based region detection.

Batch operations support glob patterns, recursive directory traversal, and parallel processing via GNU Parallel for throughput on multi-core systems. Watermark compositing uses alpha channel blending with configurable opacity and positioning. The agent generates contact sheets, animated GIF assembly from frame sequences, and SVG-to-raster conversion at arbitrary DPI for print workflows. Processing manifests in JSON track all transformations for audit compliance.

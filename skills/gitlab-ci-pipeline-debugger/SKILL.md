title: "GitLab CI Pipeline Debugger"
description: "The GitLab CI Pipeline Debugger agent provides intelligent troubleshooting for failed GitLab CI/CD pipelines. It connects to your GitLab instance via the REST API v4, fetching pipeline details, job logs, and runner configurations to diagnose build failures quickly and accurately. When a pipeline fails, the agent parses your .gitlab-ci.yml file to understand the pipeline structure including stages, jobs, dependencies, and rules. It then fetches the specific job logs using the GitLab Jobs API, applying pattern matching to identify common failure modes such as missing dependencies, Docker image pull failures, artifact expiration issues, and runner tag mismatches. The debugger understands GitLab-specific concepts like DAG dependencies with needs keyword, dynamic child pipelines, merge request pipelines vs branch pipelines, and protected variable scoping. It can trace failures across multi-project pipelines by following trigger relationships. Recommendations include specific .gitlab-ci.yml fixes with line references, runner configuration adjustments, and cache optimization strategies using the GitLab cache API."

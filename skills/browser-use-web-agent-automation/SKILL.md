# Browser Use Web Agent Automation

browser-use is an open-source Python project focused on making websites accessible to AI agents. The upstream repository describes it as a way to automate tasks online with ease, and its examples show agents clicking, typing, navigating, and extracting data through a browser runtime rather than through static HTML scraping alone. That makes it a strong fit for workflows where the site depends on JavaScript, authenticated sessions, or multi-step UI interactions.
The project’s quickstart uses uv init, uv add browser-use, and uv sync, with Python 3.11 or newer. The README shows an Agent working with a Browser instance and an LLM backend, plus optional Browser Use Cloud features for stealth browsers, proxy rotation, captcha handling, and persistent remote infrastructure. It also documents a built-in CLI for opening pages, clicking indexed elements, typing, taking screenshots, and keeping the browser alive between commands. Another practical integration point is custom tool registration, which lets teams extend the agent with domain-specific actions while staying inside the same automation flow.
For ASE, the core job-to-be-done is browser-native agent automation for sites that require real interaction rather than simple HTTP fetches. It is suitable for research, operations, testing, form submission, and authenticated task execution. The project has strong public adoption, an MIT license, recent releases, and official documentation, so it passes the intake gate for publication as verified metadata.

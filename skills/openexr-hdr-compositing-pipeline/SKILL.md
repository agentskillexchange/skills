# OpenEXR HDR Compositing Pipeline

The OpenEXR HDR Compositing Pipeline handles professional-grade HDR image workflows using OpenImageIO’s oiiotool command-line interface and the Imath half-float math library. It reads multi-layer EXR files containing beauty passes, AOVs (arbitrary output variables), and cryptomatte channels, then composites them using additive, over, and multiply blend operations. The agent applies ACES (Academy Color Encoding System) color transforms via OpenColorIO (OCIO) config files for industry-standard tone mapping from scene-linear to display-referred color spaces. Cryptomatte object isolation uses the standardized manifest format to extract individual objects by name from a single EXR render. Batch processing leverages oiiotool’s expression syntax for operations across thousands of frames. Output includes EXR for further compositing, ACES-graded TIFF for print, and sRGB PNG/JPEG for web delivery. Integrates with Nuke, Blender, and DaVinci Resolve via shared OCIO configurations.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

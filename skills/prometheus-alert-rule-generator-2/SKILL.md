The Prometheus Alert Rule Generator translates natural language alert descriptions into valid PromQL expressions and Prometheus alerting rule YAML configurations. It queries the Prometheus HTTP API to discover available metrics, labels, and recording rules, then constructs appropriate PromQL expressions with correct aggregation and threshold logic. The agent validates generated rules by executing them against the Prometheus query endpoint to ensure they return expected result types. It also generates corresponding Alertmanager routing configurations with receiver definitions for Slack, email, and webhook targets. Grafana dashboard annotations are automatically created to correlate alert windows with metric visualizations. The tool supports templating for common patterns like SLO-based alerting, rate-of-change detection, and percentile threshold monitoring. Rule files are output in standard Prometheus rule group format ready for deployment via Prometheus Operator or static configuration.

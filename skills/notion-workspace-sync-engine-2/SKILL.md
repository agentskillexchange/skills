description: "The Notion Workspace Sync Engine establishes bidirectional synchronization between Notion databases and external project management tools using the Notion API v1. It polls Notion databases via the /databases/{id}/query endpoint with filter and sort parameters to detect changes, comparing timestamps against a local state cache for incremental processing. Property mapping is configured through a declarative schema that translates Notion select/multi-select properties to Jira issue types and labels, Notion date ranges to GitHub milestone dates, and Notion relation properties to Linear issue parent-child hierarchies. The skill handles rich text conversion between Notion blocks (paragraphs, headings, code, callouts) and Markdown/HTML formats used by target platforms. Conflict resolution uses a last-writer-wins strategy with configurable field-level priority rules—for example, status changes in Jira always win, but description edits in Notion take precedence. Webhook endpoints receive real-time Notion database change events for near-instant propagation. The sync engine maintains an audit log of all operations, supports dry-run mode for previewing changes, and includes rollback capability to revert the last N sync operations."

# Notion Workspace Sync Engine

The Notion Workspace Sync Engine establishes bidirectional synchronization between Notion databases and external project management tools using the Notion API v1. It polls Notion databases via the /databases/{id}/query endpoint with filter and sort parameters to detect changes, comparing timestamps against a local state cache for incremental processing. Property mapping is configured through a declarative schema that translates Notion select/multi-select properties to Jira issue types and labels, Notion date ranges to GitHub milestone dates, and Notion relation properties to Linear issue parent-child hierarchies. The skill handles rich text conversion between Notion blocks (paragraphs, headings, code, callouts) and Markdown/HTML formats used by target platforms. Conflict resolution uses a last-writer-wins strategy with configurable field-level priority rules—for example, status changes in Jira always win, but description edits in Notion take precedence. Webhook endpoints receive real-time Notion database change events for near-instant propagation. The sync engine maintains an audit log of all operations, supports dry-run mode for previewing changes, and includes rollback capability to revert the last N sync operations.

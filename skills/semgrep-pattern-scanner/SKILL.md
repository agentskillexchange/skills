The agent executes semgrep scan with –sarif output for direct integration with GitHub Advanced Security and the Code Scanning API. It supports taint mode analysis by defining source-sink-sanitizer rules to track dangerous data flows across function boundaries. For monorepo support, it uses –include/–exclude glob patterns and respects .semgrepignore files. The scanner handles multiple languages simultaneously including Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, and Ruby through Semgrep generic pattern syntax.

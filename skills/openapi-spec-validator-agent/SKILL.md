# OpenAPI Spec Validator

The OpenAPI Spec Validator skill performs comprehensive validation of OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specifications using the Spectral CLI linting engine with custom and built-in rulesets. It parses specifications using the Swagger Parser library to resolve $ref references, validate schema correctness, and detect circular references. The skill compares specification versions to identify breaking changes including removed endpoints, narrowed parameter types, and new required fields using the oasdiff library. Features include custom Spectral rule authoring for organization-specific API standards, security scheme validation against OWASP API Security Top 10, and automated SDK generation compatibility checking. Supports bulk validation across API gateway configurations, mock server generation from examples using Prism, and API documentation quality scoring based on description coverage and example completeness.

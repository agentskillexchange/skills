Downloaded images are stored with consistent naming conventions and tracked in a local SQLite database to prevent duplicate downloads across sessions. The skill generates proper attribution HTML snippets per Pexels licensing requirements, including photographer name, profile link, and Pexels source URL. Batch mode processes keyword lists from CSV files, downloading top-N results per keyword with configurable quality (original, large2x, large, medium). Image post-processing options include resizing via sharp.js, format conversion to WebP/AVIF, and EXIF metadata stripping for privacy. Rate limiting respects Pexels&#8217; 200 requests/hour quota with automatic throttling. Integration hooks support direct upload to WordPress media library via REST API, S3 buckets, or Cloudinary."

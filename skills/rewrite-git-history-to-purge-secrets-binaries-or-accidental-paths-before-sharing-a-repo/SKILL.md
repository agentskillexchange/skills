# Rewrite Git history to purge secrets, binaries, or accidental paths before sharing a repo

Use git-filter-repo when an agent needs to surgically rewrite repository history after a leaked secret, a huge binary commit, or a bad subtree split. The agent analyzes the problem, builds the rewrite command, and leaves a clean follow-up checklist for force-push, clone reset, and downstream cleanup.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

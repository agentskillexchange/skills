Generates unified schemas from OpenAPI specifications using graphql-mesh transforms. Supports real-time data subscriptions via WebSocket transport with automatic reconnection. Implements query complexity analysis and depth limiting to prevent abusive queries. Includes response caching at the field level using cache-control directives. Monitors resolver performance with distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry spans exported to Jaeger or Zipkin."

# WP Multisite Network Sync Agent

The WP Multisite Network Sync Agent provides comprehensive automation for managing large WordPress Multisite installations. It leverages the WP_Site_Query class to enumerate all network sites and uses switch_to_blog() for cross-site content operations. The agent monitors REST API endpoints across all subsites using wp_remote_get() with parallel requests, detecting configuration drift and plugin version mismatches. It automates new site provisioning through wp_insert_site() with custom blog templates, applying predefined theme settings and plugin activations via activate_plugin(). The synchronization engine handles user role mapping across sites using add_user_to_blog() and supports scheduled sync operations through WP-Cron with wp_schedule_event(). Database operations use $wpdb->get_blog_prefix() for safe cross-site queries. Includes rollback capabilities using WordPress transients for state tracking and WP_Filesystem for safe file operations during theme and plugin sync.

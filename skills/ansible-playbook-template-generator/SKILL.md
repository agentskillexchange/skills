# Ansible Playbook Template Generator

The Ansible Playbook Template Generator creates production-ready playbooks following Ansible best practices. It selects appropriate built-in modules from ansible-core including ansible.builtin.copy, ansible.builtin.template, ansible.builtin.service, and ansible.builtin.package with proper parameter specifications. The skill constructs handler chains with listen groups for cascading service restarts after configuration changes. Role structures follow the standard directory layout with defaults, vars, tasks, handlers, templates, and meta dependencies. Jinja2 templates use proper filter chains including default(), mandatory(), and custom filters with correct whitespace control using trim blocks and lstrip. Vault-encrypted variable files are managed with vault-id labels for multi-environment secret separation. The generator handles inventory patterns with group variables, host patterns using limit expressions, and dynamic inventory scripts for cloud provider integration. Includes proper error handling with block/rescue/always structures and async task patterns for long-running operations.

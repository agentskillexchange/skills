# Normalize raw CLI output into JSON for reliable downstream parsing and automation

Uses jc to turn command output and supported file formats into structured JSON so an agent can filter, diff, validate, and store results without brittle regex parsing. Best when a workflow already depends on standard CLI tools but needs machine-readable output for the next step.

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# Midjourney Prompt Engineering Suite

The Midjourney Prompt Engineering Suite provides intelligent prompt construction and optimization for Midjourney image generation. It analyzes input descriptions and automatically selects optimal parameters including aspect ratio, stylize value, chaos level, and quality settings based on the intended output use case.

The skill maintains a prompt template library organized by genre (photorealistic, illustration, 3D render, abstract) with tested parameter combinations. It supports multi-prompt weighting syntax and negative prompting to exclude unwanted elements. Style reference images can be provided via URLs with configurable style weight blending.

A/B testing functionality leverages the Replicate prediction API to generate variant images with systematic parameter sweeps, scoring outputs using CLIP similarity against the target description. Results are compiled into comparison grids with metadata annotations. The suite includes prompt history tracking, favorite management, and export to JSON for team sharing. Batch generation queues handle rate limiting gracefully with exponential backoff.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

# Railway App Deployer

Railway App Deployer is built around GraphQL API ecosystem. The underlying ecosystem is represented by graphql/graphql-js (20,335+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like queries, mutations, schema introspection, fragments, pagination, subscriptions and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks. In deployment workflows, the skill acts as a control layer around graphql operations so an agent can inspect current state, compute a diff, surface rollout risk, and only then trigger the change path. The implementation typically relies on queries, mutations, schema introspection, fragments, pagination, subscriptions, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform. Accesses queries, mutations, schema introspection, fragments, pagination, subscriptions instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry. Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result. Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.

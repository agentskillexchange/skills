title: "SonarQube Analysis Runner"
description: "The SonarQube Analysis Runner skill integrates with SonarQube Server or SonarCloud to perform comprehensive static code analysis directly from your agent workflow. It leverages the SonarQube Web API (api/qualitygates, api/measures, api/issues) alongside the sonar-scanner CLI to trigger project scans, monitor analysis tasks via api/ce/task, and retrieve results programmatically. The skill supports configuring quality profiles per language, setting custom quality gate conditions, and filtering issues by severity (BLOCKER, CRITICAL, MAJOR). It handles multi-branch analysis with proper sonar.branch.name parameters, pull request decoration via api/project_pull_requests, and can export findings in SARIF format for GitHub Advanced Security integration. Authentication is managed through sonar.login tokens with granular project-level permissions. The runner automatically waits for background task completion and parses the analysis report to provide actionable summaries of new issues introduced."

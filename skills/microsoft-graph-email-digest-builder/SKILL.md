# Microsoft Graph Email Digest Builder

The Microsoft Graph Email Digest Builder creates structured summaries of unread emails from Microsoft 365 accounts. It queries the Microsoft Graph API /me/messages endpoint with OData filters for receivedDateTime ranges and isRead status. Emails are grouped into categories using the inferenceClassification property (focused vs other) and further organized by conversationId for thread-based grouping. The skill extracts key information including subject lines, sender names, preview text from body.content, and attachment metadata via the /attachments sub-resource. Priority scoring uses a weighted algorithm combining sender importance (based on recent reply frequency queried via /me/mailFolders/sentItems/messages), email flags (importance and flag.flagStatus properties), and keyword matching against user-defined priority terms. The final digest is formatted as a structured document with sections for urgent items, thread summaries, and low-priority notifications. Supports delta queries via /me/messages/delta for incremental updates since the last digest generation. Integrates with Microsoft Teams via the /me/chats endpoint to include Teams message notifications in the unified digest.

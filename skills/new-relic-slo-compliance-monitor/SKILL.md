title: "New Relic SLO Compliance Monitor"
description: "The New Relic SLO Compliance Monitor continuously tracks service level objective compliance by querying New Relic through the NerdGraph GraphQL API. It constructs NRQL queries to calculate availability, latency percentiles, and throughput metrics against defined SLO targets. Error budget consumption is tracked in real-time with configurable alert thresholds for budget burn rate acceleration. The agent supports multi-window burn rate alerting following Google SRE best practices with 1-hour, 6-hour, and 30-day evaluation windows. Compliance reports are generated with historical trend charts showing SLO attainment over configurable time periods. When error budgets approach exhaustion, the agent sends detailed notifications via Slack Incoming Webhooks including current burn rate, time until budget depletion, and top error contributors. Integration with New Relic Workloads enables entity-level SLO tracking across service groups. The tool maintains SLO definitions as code in YAML format for version-controlled SLO management."

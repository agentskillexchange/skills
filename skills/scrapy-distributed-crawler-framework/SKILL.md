description: "The Scrapy Distributed Crawler Framework enables scalable web data collection across multiple crawler instances. Built on Scrapy framework with scrapy-redis extension, it distributes URL frontier management across Redis queues enabling horizontal scaling of crawler workers without duplicate URL processing. JavaScript-rendered content is handled through Splash integration via scrapy-splash middleware, providing a lightweight alternative to full browser automation for pages requiring JS execution. The framework respects crawl ethics with built-in robots.txt compliance, AutoThrottle extension for adaptive request rate management, and configurable politeness delays per domain. Data flows through configurable item pipelines including validation, deduplication via MinHash fingerprinting, and storage to MongoDB through the scrapy-mongodb pipeline extension. Media files are downloaded via the built-in FilesPipeline with S3 backend storage support. Monitoring uses Scrapy stats collection exported to Prometheus via a custom StatsD exporter, with Grafana dashboards for real-time crawl progress visualization. Spider contracts provide automated testing for extraction logic."

# Scrapy Distributed Crawler Framework

The Scrapy Distributed Crawler Framework enables scalable web data collection across multiple crawler instances.

Data flows through configurable item pipelines including validation, deduplication via MinHash fingerprinting, and storage to MongoDB through the scrapy-mongodb pipeline extension. Media files are downloaded via the built-in FilesPipeline with S3 backend storage support. Monitoring uses Scrapy stats collection exported to Prometheus via a custom StatsD exporter, with Grafana dashboards for real-time crawl progress visualization. Spider contracts provide automated testing for extraction logic.

description: "The Puppeteer Stealth Web Scraper uses puppeteer-extra with the puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth module to launch headless Chrome instances that evade common bot detection systems like Cloudflare, PerimeterX, and DataDome.

Proxy rotation is handled through the Bright Data API with automatic IP cycling on detection events. Extracted HTML is processed using Cheerio for efficient jQuery-style DOM traversal and data extraction without full browser rendering overhead. Concurrency is managed via p-queue to respect rate limits while maximizing throughput across multiple target domains. The agent supports structured data extraction with CSS selector templates, automatic pagination handling, and CAPTCHA solving integration via 2Captcha API. Scraped data is validated against JSON Schema definitions before being output as CSV, JSON, or directly inserted into databases via Knex.js query builder."

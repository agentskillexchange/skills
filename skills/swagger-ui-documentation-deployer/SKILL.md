# Swagger UI Documentation Deployer

This skill deploys interactive API documentation portals using Swagger UI and Redoc from OpenAPI specification files. It configures Swagger UI with custom branding including logos, color schemes, and typography matching organizational design systems. Authentication preset configuration enables Try It Out functionality with pre-populated API keys, OAuth2 client credentials, and JWT tokens for developer testing. The deployer generates static HTML builds suitable for CDN hosting on S3, CloudFront, or GitHub Pages with proper cache headers and content security policies. Multiple spec versions are supported through a version selector dropdown with automatic redirect from latest paths. The skill embeds custom CSS and JavaScript plugins for enhanced functionality including request history, response diffing, and webhook simulation. Redoc integration provides an alternative three-panel layout with nested schema visualization. Search functionality indexes endpoint descriptions, parameter names, and schema properties for quick navigation. Analytics integration tracks endpoint usage patterns to identify popular and underutilized API surfaces.

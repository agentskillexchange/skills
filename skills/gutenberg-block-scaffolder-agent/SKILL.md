# Gutenberg Block Scaffolder

Gutenberg Block Scaffolder automates the creation of WordPress editor blocks following the Block API v3 specification. It uses the @wordpress/create-block scaffold tool as a foundation, then customizes output based on your requirements.


The agent generates complete block packages including block.json metadata with apiVersion 3, edit.js with useBlockProps and InspectorControls, save.js with proper serialization, and optional render.php for dynamic server-side rendering. It supports InnerBlocks with allowedBlocks and template locking, custom BlockControls toolbars, and the new viewScriptModule field for frontend interactivity.


Integrates with @wordpress/scripts for build configuration, generates proper webpack.config.js overrides when needed, and produces PHPUnit test stubs for render_callback functions. Supports block variations, block styles, and block patterns registration via register_block_pattern().

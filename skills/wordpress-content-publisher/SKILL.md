# WordPress Content Publisher

WordPress Content Publisher is built around WordPress CMS and REST API ecosystem. The underlying ecosystem is represented by WordPress/WordPress (20,973+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like posts, pages, taxonomies, media, custom fields, auth, plugin hooks and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks. For content workflows, the skill uses wordpress primitives as the system of record, so an agent can read structured inputs, apply transformations, and publish or sync output without losing metadata, IDs, or status fields. The original use case is clear: Structured publishing workflow for WordPress drafts, metadata, and content operations.

# Terraform Module Testing Framework

The Terraform Module Testing Framework skill implements comprehensive testing strategies for Terraform infrastructure modules using both the Terratest Go testing library and the native terraform test framework introduced in Terraform 1.6. Unit tests validate module logic by examining terraform plan JSON output for expected resource configurations, attribute values, and dependency relationships without provisioning real infrastructure. Integration tests use Terratest to apply modules in ephemeral cloud environments, verify deployed resource properties through provider APIs, and automatically destroy resources after assertions complete. The skill manages test fixtures with varying input variable combinations to exercise conditional logic branches within modules. Parallel test execution with unique resource naming prevents conflicts between concurrent test runs. Contract tests validate that module outputs conform to expected schemas for consumption by downstream modules. The skill integrates with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI to run tests on pull requests, caching provider plugins and state files for faster execution cycles.

description: "The ESLint Auto-Fix Agent skill provides automated code quality enforcement for JavaScript and TypeScript projects using ESLint v9 with the new flat config system (eslint.config.js). It utilizes the ESLint Node.js API (new ESLint(), lintFiles(), outputFixes()) to programmatically scan source files, apply auto-fixable corrections, and generate detailed reports. The skill integrates with lint-staged and husky for pre-commit hook workflows, ensuring only staged files are processed. It supports popular plugin ecosystems including @typescript-eslint/parser, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-import, and eslint-plugin-prettier. Configuration management handles extending shared configs like eslint-config-airbnb-base and eslint-config-standard. The agent can diff before/after states, categorize unfixable issues by rule ID, and suggest manual fixes based on rule documentation URLs. It also supports suppression comments generation and inline disable directives for acknowledged technical debt."

The skill integrates with lint-staged and husky for pre-commit hook workflows, ensuring only staged files are processed. It supports popular plugin ecosystems including @typescript-eslint/parser, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-import, and eslint-plugin-prettier. Configuration management handles extending shared configs like eslint-config-airbnb-base and eslint-config-standard. The agent can diff before/after states, categorize unfixable issues by rule ID, and suggest manual fixes based on rule documentation URLs. It also supports suppression comments generation and inline disable directives for acknowledged technical debt.

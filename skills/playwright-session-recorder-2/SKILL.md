# Playwright Session Recorder

The Playwright Session Recorder skill leverages the Playwright codegen engine to capture full browser interaction sessions in real time. It hooks into page navigation, click events, form submissions, and AJAX requests to produce clean, replayable TypeScript or Python test scripts.
Key capabilities include automatic HAR file generation for network traffic analysis, DOM snapshot capture at configurable intervals, and intelligent selector generation that prefers data-testid attributes over fragile CSS paths. The skill supports multi-tab recording, iframe traversal, and authentication flow capture with credential masking.
Output formats include Playwright Test files, raw JSON action logs, and Markdown session summaries. Integration with CI pipelines allows recorded sessions to become regression tests automatically. The recorder handles cookie consent dialogs, popup blockers, and CAPTCHA pauses gracefully.

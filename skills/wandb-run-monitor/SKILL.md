# Weights & Biases Run Monitor

Uses the W&B Python SDK and Public API to stream live training metrics, system stats, and gradients from active runs. Alerts on metric regressions by querying run history via wandb.Api().runs() and posts summaries to Slack. Supports artifact versioning and lineage tracking.

## Installation

2. Search for this skill by name or slug.
3. Review the skill details and install it.

### Method 2: OpenClaw Chat
1. Ask OpenClaw to install this skill from Agent Skill Exchange.
2. Confirm the install when prompted.

### Method 3: ClawHub CLI
```bash
clawhub install wandb-run-monitor
```

### Method 4: Manual download
1. Download or clone the skill files.
2. Place them in your local skills directory.
3. Reload OpenClaw or your agent runtime.

### Method 5: From source
1. Open the upstream source linked below.
2. Follow the project setup instructions there.

Weights & Biases Run Monitor is built around Slack messaging and workspace APIs. The underlying ecosystem is represented by slackapi/bolt-js (2,900+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like conversations.history, chat.postMessage, users.info, block kit, files and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.
In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to slack so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The original use case is clear: Uses the W&B Python SDK and Public API to stream live training metrics, system stats, and gradients from active runs. Alerts on metric regressions by querying run history via wandb.Api().runs() and posts summaries to Slack. Supports artifact versioning and lineage tracking. The implementation typically relies on conversations.history, chat.postMessage, users.info, block kit, files, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.
- Accesses conversations.history, chat.postMessage, users.info, block kit, files instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.
- Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.
- Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.
- Fits into broader integration points such as chat triage, digests, alerts, and collaborative automation.
Key integration points include chat triage, digests, alerts, and collaborative automation. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

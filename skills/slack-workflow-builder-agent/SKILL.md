# Slack Workflow Builder Agent

The Slack Workflow Builder Agent automates complex team workflows using @slack/bolt for event handling and @slack/web-api for programmatic Slack interaction. It creates rich interactive experiences using Block Kit components including modals, message attachments, and action buttons.

The agent handles slash command registration and processing, building multi-step approval workflows where each step triggers the next based on user interaction. It manages channel creation, archival, and topic updates programmatically, and supports threaded conversation management for organized team discussions.

Advanced features include scheduled message delivery using chat.scheduleMessage, user group management via usergroups API methods, and file sharing automation through files.upload v2. The agent implements Slack Events API subscriptions for real-time message monitoring, reaction tracking, and channel membership changes. It also builds custom Home Tab experiences using the views.publish endpoint for personalized dashboards.

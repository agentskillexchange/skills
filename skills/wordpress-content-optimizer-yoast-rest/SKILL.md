# WordPress Content Optimizer

Optimizes WordPress posts for SEO using the Yoast SEO REST API fields alongside WP REST API v2 for content updates. Analyzes readability via textstat Python library and generates meta descriptions with Claude API prompt chains.

This skill provides a comprehensive automation layer for developers and teams who need reliable, repeatable workflows. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and error recovery automatically, so you can focus on the logic that matters. The agent monitors for changes in real time and applies incremental updates to minimize API calls and reduce latency. Configuration is handled through a simple YAML manifest that defines inputs, outputs, and trigger conditions. Built-in logging captures every action for audit trails and debugging. Supports both interactive and headless modes, making it suitable for CI/CD pipelines as well as local development. The skill includes pre-built templates for common use cases and can be extended with custom plugins. Error handling follows exponential backoff with jitter for transient failures and provides clear diagnostic messages for permanent errors. Compatible with major operating systems and containerized environments. Tested against production workloads with comprehensive integration test suites.

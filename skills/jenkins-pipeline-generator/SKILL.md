# Jenkins Pipeline Generator

The Jenkins Pipeline Generator skill automates the creation of declarative and scripted Jenkins pipeline definitions following the official Pipeline Syntax reference. It generates Jenkinsfile content with proper stage definitions, parallel execution blocks, post-condition handlers, and agent specifications for both traditional and Kubernetes-based executors.
This skill integrates with the Jenkins REST API (/api/json) to discover existing job configurations, installed plugins, and available build agents. It queries the Blue Ocean API endpoints for pipeline run visualization data and uses the Pipeline Model Definition API to validate generated pipeline syntax before deployment.
Shared library integration is a core capability, generating vars/ scripts and src/ classes that follow Jenkins shared library conventions. The skill creates library configurations with proper @Library annotations and manages version pinning for reproducible builds across teams.
Advanced features include generating multibranch pipeline configurations with custom branch discovery strategies, creating pipeline templates for common patterns like build-test-deploy with approval gates, and configuring credential bindings using the Jenkins Credentials API. The skill also generates proper Groovy sandbox-compatible code to avoid script approval requirements.

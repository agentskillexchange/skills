# PagerDuty Incident Escalator

The PagerDuty Incident Escalator skill automates incident management through the PagerDuty REST API v2. It creates incidents via POST /incidents with proper urgency levels, escalation_policy references, and service associations. The skill monitors incident status transitions using GET /incidents with status filters and date_range parameters. Related incidents are automatically detected through title similarity scoring and merged via PUT /incidents merge to reduce alert fatigue. Escalation policy management uses the /escalation_policies endpoint to dynamically adjust on-call rotations based on incident severity and team availability queried from /oncalls. The skill generates postmortem templates by reconstructing incident timelines from log_entries with full context. Priority classification leverages /priorities to map business impact to PagerDuty priority levels (P1-P5). Response play automation triggers predefined response procedures for critical incidents. Integration with services and integrations endpoints enables automatic incident creation from monitoring tool webhooks. Analytics data from /analytics/metrics/incidents provides mean-time-to-acknowledge and mean-time-to-resolve metrics for continuous improvement tracking.

description: "The ArgoCD GitOps Sync Automator manages the full lifecycle of ArgoCD applications by interfacing with the ArgoCD Server API (both gRPC and REST endpoints) for application creation, synchronization, and health monitoring. It uses argocd-autopilot for bootstrapping ArgoCD installations and managing the GitOps repository structure with proper directory conventions. The skill generates ApplicationSet resources with matrix and list generators for multi-cluster deployments, implementing sync waves and resource hooks for ordered rollout strategies. It integrates with the ArgoCD Notifications Controller to configure alert destinations via Slack, Teams, and PagerDuty webhooks. The automator monitors application health using ArgoCD&#8217;s built-in health assessments and custom Lua health checks, automatically triggering rollbacks when degraded states are detected. It supports progressive delivery patterns through integration with Argo Rollouts for canary and blue-green deployment strategies with automated analysis using Prometheus metrics queries."

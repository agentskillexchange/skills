# GitLab CI Pipeline Dependency Tracer

This skill uses the GitLab REST API (gitlab.com/api/v4) to fetch pipeline definitions and job dependency metadata. It builds a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of job relationships using the needs keyword and identifies critical path bottlenecks that force serialization. The skill calls the GitLab Pipelines API to pull historical duration data across branches and computes median stage latency. When bottlenecks are detected, it generates refactored .gitlab-ci.yml snippets with corrected needs declarations. Integration with the GitLab Merge Requests API enables automatic posting of a structured optimization report as an MR comment, including a Mermaid diagram of the corrected pipeline graph. Compatible with GitLab SaaS, self-managed, and GitLab Dedicated.

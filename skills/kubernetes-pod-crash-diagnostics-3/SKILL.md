# Kubernetes Pod Crash Diagnostics

Kubernetes Pod Crash Diagnostics is built around Kubernetes orchestration platform. The underlying ecosystem is represented by kubernetes/kubernetes (121,313+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like kubectl, API server, pods, deployments, events, logs, probes, RBAC and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks. In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to kubernetes so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The original use case is clear: Runs kubectl describe pod, kubectl logs &#8211;previous, and kubectl get events to diagnose CrashLoopBackOff and OOMKilled pods.

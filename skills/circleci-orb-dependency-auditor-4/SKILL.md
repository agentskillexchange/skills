It parses orb source YAML to extract Docker executor image references and submits them to Trivy (aquasec/trivy) for container vulnerability scanning. The skill generates a dependency report showing version lag, CVE counts by severity (critical/high/medium/low), and upgrade compatibility scores. It can produce automated .circleci/config.yml patches that bump orb versions with appropriate changelog links. Namespace trust verification checks orb publisher identity against the CircleCI certified/partner program. The auditor flags community orbs lacking recent maintenance (no commits in 6+ months) and suggests certified alternatives from the circleci/ namespace."

# CircleCI Orb Dependency Auditor

The CircleCI Orb Dependency Auditor skill performs comprehensive security and version auditing of CircleCI orb dependencies in .circleci/config.yml files. It queries the CircleCI v2 API (/api/v2/orb) and the public orb registry to compare pinned versions against latest releases.

It parses orb source YAML to extract Docker executor image references and submits them to Trivy (aquasec/trivy) for container vulnerability scanning. The skill generates a dependency report showing version lag, CVE counts by severity (critical/high/medium/low), and upgrade compatibility scores. It can produce automated .circleci/config.yml patches that bump orb versions with appropriate changelog links. Namespace trust verification checks orb publisher identity against the CircleCI certified/partner program. The auditor flags community orbs lacking recent maintenance (no commits in 6+ months) and suggests certified alternatives from the circleci/ namespace.

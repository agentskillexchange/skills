The skill supports matrix strategy configurations for multi-version testing, reusable workflow definitions with workflow_call triggers and input/output/secret definitions, and composite action authoring in action.yml files. It leverages the Actions REST API (repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows, actions/runs) for triggering workflow_dispatch events, monitoring run status, downloading artifacts via actions/artifacts, and managing repository secrets through the API with libsodium encryption.

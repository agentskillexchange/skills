# Swagger / OpenAPI Validator

Swagger / OpenAPI Validator is built around Swagger/OpenAPI tooling. The underlying ecosystem is represented by swagger-api/swagger-ui (28,702+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like spec validation, schemas, client generation, Swagger UI, examples, refs and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks.

In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to swagger so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The implementation typically relies on spec validation, schemas, client generation, Swagger UI, examples, refs, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

Accesses spec validation, schemas, client generation, Swagger UI, examples, refs instead of scraping a UI, which makes runs easier to audit and retry.
Supports structured inputs and outputs so another tool, agent, or CI step can consume the result.
Can be wired into cron jobs, webhook handlers, MCP transports, or local CLI workflows depending on the skill format.
Fits into broader integration points such as API contracts, docs, SDK generation, and endpoint verification.

 Key integration points include API contracts, docs, SDK generation, and endpoint verification. In a real environment that usually means passing credentials through env vars or app config, respecting rate limits and permission scopes, and returning structured artifacts that can be attached to tickets, pull requests, dashboards, or follow-up automations.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

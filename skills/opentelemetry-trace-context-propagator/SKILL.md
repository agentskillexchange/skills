description: "This skill provides a complete OpenTelemetry trace context propagation implementation using the @opentelemetry/api and @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node packages. It configures the W3CTraceContextPropagator and W3CBaggagePropagator for injecting and extracting traceparent, tracestate, and baggage headers across HTTP requests via the @opentelemetry/instrumentation-http module. For gRPC services it uses the @opentelemetry/instrumentation-grpc interceptor. Message queue propagation covers AWS SQS message attributes and Kafka headers using the @opentelemetry/instrumentation-aws-sdk and kafkajs context injection. The skill configures OTLP exporters for Jaeger and Zipkin, with sampling strategies including parent-based and trace-id ratio samplers. Resource detectors for AWS ECS and GCP Cloud Run automatically populate service metadata. Includes setup for the OpenTelemetry Collector as an aggregation layer."

# AWS S3 & SQS Pipeline Connector

The AWS S3 & SQS Pipeline Connector builds event-driven data processing pipelines using AWS SDK v3 modular clients. It combines S3 object storage with SQS message queuing for reliable, scalable data workflows.

S3 operations use @aws-sdk/client-s3 with commands including PutObjectCommand for uploads with server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS), GetObjectCommand for streaming downloads, CopyObjectCommand for cross-bucket transfers, and ListObjectsV2Command for inventory. Multipart uploads via CreateMultipartUploadCommand handle large files with configurable part sizes and parallel upload streams.

SQS integration through @aws-sdk/client-sqs provides reliable message processing. SendMessageCommand and SendMessageBatchCommand handle message publishing with deduplication IDs for FIFO queues. ReceiveMessageCommand with WaitTimeSeconds enables long polling for efficient message consumption, and DeleteMessageCommand provides explicit acknowledgment after successful processing.

The pipeline is connected via S3 Event Notifications configured to send s3:ObjectCreated:* events to SQS queues. The agent manages notification configuration through PutBucketNotificationConfigurationCommand, sets up dead-letter queues for failed processing, and implements visibility timeout management for retry handling. Additional features include S3 Select for server-side filtering with SelectObjectContentCommand, S3 Batch Operations for bulk processing, and CloudWatch metrics monitoring for queue depth alerting.

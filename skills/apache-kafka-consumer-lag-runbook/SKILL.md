description: "This skill connects to a Kafka cluster using the Apache Kafka AdminClient API (kafka-clients library) and queries consumer group offsets via the listConsumerGroupOffsets method. It cross-references committed offsets with latest partition offsets to calculate per-partition lag. JMX metrics are fetched from broker MBeans (kafka.server:type=FetcherLagMetrics) or, for Confluent Cloud, via the Confluent Metrics API REST endpoint. The skill identifies hotspot partitions by comparing lag growth rates across a rolling 10-minute window. Common root causes are diagnosed: slow deserialization, GC pauses, downstream database saturation, and rebalance loops triggered by session.timeout.ms misconfig. A step-by-step Markdown runbook is generated with exact configuration property changes and kafka-consumer-groups.sh commands for immediate lag reduction."

# Apache Kafka Consumer Lag Runbook

This skill connects to a Kafka cluster using the Apache Kafka AdminClient API (kafka-clients library) and queries consumer group offsets via the listConsumerGroupOffsets method. It cross-references committed offsets with latest partition offsets to calculate per-partition lag. JMX metrics are fetched from broker MBeans (kafka.server:type=FetcherLagMetrics) or, for Confluent Cloud, via the Confluent Metrics API REST endpoint. The skill identifies hotspot partitions by comparing lag growth rates across a rolling 10-minute window. Common root causes are diagnosed: slow deserialization, GC pauses, downstream database saturation, and rebalance loops triggered by session.timeout.ms misconfig. A step-by-step Markdown runbook is generated with exact configuration property changes and kafka-consumer-groups.sh commands for immediate lag reduction.

title: "Playwright PDF Export Automation"
description: "This skill leverages the Playwright browser automation library to generate high-fidelity PDF documents from any web URL or local HTML file. It uses chromium.launch({ headless: true }) to spin up a headless Chromium instance, then navigates to the target page using page.goto() with configurable waitUntil options (load, domcontentloaded, networkidle). The PDF generation uses page.pdf() with full control over format (A4, Letter, Legal), margins (top, bottom, left, right in CSS units), scale factor, print background graphics, and custom header/footer HTML templates. The skill handles authentication scenarios by injecting cookies via context.addCookies() or setting HTTP headers. It includes retry logic for pages with lazy-loaded content, using page.waitForSelector() to ensure all dynamic content is rendered before capture. Output PDFs are saved locally or uploaded to S3 via the AWS SDK putObject API. Ideal for invoice generation, report archiving, and compliance documentation workflows."

# Playwright PDF Export Automation

This skill leverages the Playwright browser automation library to generate high-fidelity PDF documents from any web URL or local HTML file. It uses chromium.launch({ headless: true }) to spin up a headless Chromium instance, then navigates to the target page using page.goto() with configurable waitUntil options (load, domcontentloaded, networkidle). The PDF generation uses page.pdf() with full control over format (A4, Letter, Legal), margins (top, bottom, left, right in CSS units), scale factor, print background graphics, and custom header/footer HTML templates. The skill handles authentication scenarios by injecting cookies via context.addCookies() or setting HTTP headers. It includes retry logic for pages with lazy-loaded content, using page.waitForSelector() to ensure all dynamic content is rendered before capture. Output PDFs are saved locally or uploaded to S3 via the AWS SDK putObject API. Ideal for invoice generation, report archiving, and compliance documentation workflows.

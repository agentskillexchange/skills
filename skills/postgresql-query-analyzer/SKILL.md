# PostgreSQL Query Analyzer

Analyzes PostgreSQL slow queries using EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) output and pg_stat_statements views. Identifies missing indexes via pg_stat_user_tables sequential scan counters and suggests index creation with HypoPG extension.

1. Open the upstream source linked below.
2. Follow the project setup instructions there.

The PostgreSQL Query Analyzer skill provides deep performance analysis for PostgreSQL databases by examining query execution plans and runtime statistics. It processes EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) output to identify performance bottlenecks including sequential scans on large tables, nested loop joins with high row estimates, and excessive buffer hits.
The skill queries pg_stat_statements to identify the top resource-consuming queries by total execution time, mean latency, and shared buffer usage. It correlates this data with pg_stat_user_tables to find tables with high sequential scan ratios that would benefit from indexing.
For index recommendations, the skill uses the HypoPG extension to create hypothetical indexes and re-run EXPLAIN to validate that proposed indexes would actually improve query performance before creating them. It supports B-tree, GiST, GIN, and BRIN index type recommendations based on column data types and query patterns.
Additional diagnostics include lock contention analysis via pg_stat_activity and pg_locks, connection pool utilization tracking, vacuum and autovacuum status monitoring, and table bloat estimation using pgstattuple. The skill generates actionable reports with SQL commands for implementing recommended optimizations.
Compatible with PostgreSQL 13+ and works with both self-hosted and managed instances (RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure Database).

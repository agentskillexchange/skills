# GitLab CI Pipeline Optimizer

The GitLab CI Pipeline Optimizer analyzes and restructures .gitlab-ci.yml configurations for maximum pipeline efficiency. Using the GitLab Pipelines API and Jobs API, it maps job dependency graphs and identifies parallelization opportunities through the needs keyword and DAG configurations. The skill profiles cache hit rates across projects using the GitLab Cache API, recommends optimal cache key strategies, and implements distributed caching with S3-compatible backends. It restructures pipeline stages to minimize wait times, converts sequential jobs to parallel matrices, and implements rules-based conditional execution to skip unnecessary work. The optimizer also configures interruptible jobs for merge request pipelines, sets up merge trains for high-throughput repositories, and implements parent-child pipelines for monorepo architectures. Additional capabilities include resource group management for deployment serialization, pipeline schedules via the Schedules API, and automated pipeline analytics reporting with trend analysis across branches.

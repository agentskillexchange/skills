# Python Package Dependency Graph Mapper

The Python Package Dependency Graph Mapper queries the PyPI JSON API (https://pypi.org/pypi/{package}/json) to resolve package metadata and dependency specifiers, then uses the pipdeptree library to construct complete transitive dependency graphs from installed environments or requirements files. It identifies diamond dependency conflicts where two packages require incompatible versions of a shared dependency, and detects yanked package versions that may cause future installation failures. The skill generates interactive dependency visualizations using Graphviz DOT format or Mermaid diagrams suitable for documentation embedding. It calculates dependency depth metrics, identifies packages with excessive transitive dependencies (dependency bloat), and flags packages with no recent PyPI releases (potential maintenance risk). The mapper supports requirements.txt, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml, and Poetry lock file formats for comprehensive Python ecosystem coverage.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

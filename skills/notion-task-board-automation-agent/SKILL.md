description: "The Notion Task Board Automation skill manages project workflows within Notion databases using the official Notion API. It queries databases with POST /v1/databases/{id}/query using compound filter objects that combine property filters with AND/OR logic for complex view generation. The skill creates and updates pages via POST /v1/pages with rich property types including select, multi-select, date ranges, relations, and rollups. It manages status property transitions (Not Started → In Progress → Done) with validation rules and automated timestamp updates on status changes. Advanced features include relation property management for cross-database linking, formula property interpretation for computed fields, and rollup aggregation monitoring. The agent builds sorted views using multi-level sort specifications on database queries. It handles pagination through start_cursor and has_more responses for databases with 100+ items. Block content management supports appending rich text, to-do lists, and embedded content to pages. Integrates with Notion webhooks for real-time change detection and supports database property schema modifications via PATCH /v1/databases/{id} ."

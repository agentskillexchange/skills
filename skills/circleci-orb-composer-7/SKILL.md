It integrates conventional-changelog for automatic semantic versioning based on commit messages, ensuring orb versions follow semver conventions. Capabilities include generating parameterized commands with proper type validation, creating executor definitions for Docker/machine/macOS environments, building job templates with configurable steps, and producing comprehensive usage examples. The skill validates orbs against the CircleCI schema, runs integration tests using circleci local execute, and publishes to the CircleCI Orb Registry with proper namespace management.

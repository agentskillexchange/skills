# Docker Compose Service Blueprint Creator

The Docker Compose Service Blueprint Creator generates Compose files following the official Compose Specification with version-agnostic syntax. It defines multi-service architectures with proper network isolation using custom bridge networks and network aliases for service discovery. Volume configurations handle named volumes for persistent data, bind mounts for development workflows, and tmpfs mounts for ephemeral scratch space. Health checks are configured with proper test commands, intervals, timeouts, retries, and start_period values calibrated to service startup characteristics. Service dependency ordering uses depends_on with condition: service_healthy to prevent premature connection attempts. The skill handles environment variable management through env_file references, variable interpolation with default values, and Docker secrets for sensitive configuration. Build contexts specify Dockerfile paths, build arguments, target stages for multi-stage builds, and cache-from references for CI acceleration. Resource limits use deploy.resources for CPU and memory constraints compatible with both local Docker Engine and Swarm mode.

# Kubernetes Pod Crashloop Runbook

This skill queries the Kubernetes API server (typically at /api/v1 and /apis/apps/v1) using a kubeconfig or in-cluster service account token. When a pod enters CrashLoopBackOff, the skill fetches the last 100 lines of container logs via the pods/log subresource, retrieves pod events from the Events API, and checks resource quota limits in the namespace. It distinguishes between OOMKilled (memory limit exceeded), probe failures (liveness/readiness misconfiguration), and missing dependencies (ConfigMap or Secret not found). The skill cross-references the pod spec against the namespace ResourceQuota and LimitRange objects. A step-by-step Markdown runbook is generated with specific kubectl commands to apply, including suggested resource limit adjustments and probe timeout fixes. Compatible with Kubernetes 1.25+.

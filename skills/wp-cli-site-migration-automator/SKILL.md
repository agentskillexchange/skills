# WP-CLI Site Migration Automator

This skill orchestrates complete WordPress site migrations between hosts with zero downtime. It begins with wp db export to create a timestamped SQL dump, then uses rsync with –checksum for efficient file transfer of wp-content directories. The core of the migration uses wp search-replace with –precise and –all-tables flags to handle serialized PHP data in options, postmeta, and widget configurations. For multisite networks, it manages domain mapping via wp site list and wp search-replace –url targeting individual subsites. DNS preflight checks use dig to verify A/AAAA records and curl health probes to confirm the new server responds correctly before cutover. The agent manages wp-config.php updates for database credentials, table prefixes, and environment-specific constants like WP_HOME and WP_SITEURL. Post-migration validation includes wp core verify-checksums, wp plugin list –status=active comparison, and wp cron event list verification. Includes rollback procedures with automated backup restoration.

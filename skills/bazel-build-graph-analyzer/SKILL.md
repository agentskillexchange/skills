# Bazel Build Graph Analyzer

The Bazel Build Graph Analyzer provides deep inspection of Bazel build dependency structures using the Bazel Query Language and Action Graph API. It parses the Build Event Protocol (BEP) output stream to identify critical path bottlenecks and suggest parallelization improvements.


The agent executes bazel query expressions including deps(), rdeps(), allpaths(), and somepath() to map dependency chains and detect unnecessary transitive dependencies. It analyzes action execution logs from the Build Event Protocol JSON profile to compute critical path duration and identify slow actions that dominate build times.


Key capabilities include Starlark rule analysis for custom build rule optimization, repository rule caching evaluation via the repository cache API, and remote execution performance analysis using the Remote Execution API v2 metrics. The agent generates build optimization reports with concrete recommendations for target splitting, visibility restriction, and build configuration tuning using .bazelrc flag combinations. It also detects test sharding opportunities using bazel test –test_sharding_strategy analysis.

## Installation

Choose whichever fits your setup:

1. Copy this skill folder into your local skills directory.
2. Clone the repo and symlink or copy the skill into your agent workspace.
3. Add the repo as a git submodule if you manage shared skills centrally.
4. Install it through your internal provisioning or packaging workflow.
5. Download the folder directly from GitHub and place it in your skills collection.

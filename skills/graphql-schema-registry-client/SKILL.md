The skill pushes schema versions to Apollo Schema Registry using rover subgraph publish for federated subgraphs and rover graph publish for monolithic schemas. It performs pre-publish validation using graphql-inspector diff to detect breaking changes including removed fields, changed nullability, removed enum values, and modified input types. Each change is categorized by severity (breaking, dangerous, non-breaking). For federated architectures, the skill validates subgraph composition using rover supergraph compose, checking for entity reference resolution, key field compatibility, and @override directive correctness. It integrates with Apollo Schema Checks API for running composition and operation checks against real traffic data, ensuring that schema changes do not break existing client queries. The skill also generates schema changelogs and migration guides from diff outputs."

It performs pre-publish validation using graphql-inspector diff to detect breaking changes including removed fields, changed nullability, removed enum values, and modified input types.

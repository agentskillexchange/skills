# Todoist Sync API Task Orchestrator

The Todoist Sync API Task Orchestrator manages complex task workflows through the Todoist Sync API v9’s incremental synchronization model. It maintains sync_token state for efficient delta updates, sending only changed data through the /sync endpoint’s commands array for atomic batch operations.


Core operations include task creation with items_add commands supporting natural language due dates via date_string, priority levels (p1-p4), and label assignments. The orchestrator handles project hierarchy through project_add and project_move commands, and implements section-based organization via section_add for Kanban-style workflows.


Advanced capabilities include recurring task management through Todoist’s due.string expressions like “every workday at 9am”, automatic task dependency chains using item_complete triggers, and bulk operations through command batching with uuid-based idempotency. The skill integrates with Todoist webhooks for event_name-based automation triggers and uses the REST API v2 /tasks endpoint for quick single-item operations when full sync is unnecessary.

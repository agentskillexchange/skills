# GitHub Actions Matrix Build Optimizer

This skill connects to your GitHub repository using the GitHub REST API (api.github.com) and reads existing workflow YAML configurations from the .github/workflows directory. It analyzes the matrix strategy blocks, identifying redundant OS/version combinations and caching opportunities using actions/cache@v3. The skill leverages the GitHub Actions billing API to compute per-minute costs and suggests removal of low-value matrix entries. It can also integrate with the GitHub Checks API to correlate flaky test patterns with specific matrix legs. Output includes a revised workflow file with savings annotations, a Markdown summary of estimated monthly cost reduction, and optional PR creation via the GitHub Pull Requests API. Supports both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise Server endpoints.

# Packer Image Builder

Packer Image Builder is built around Docker container platform. The underlying ecosystem is represented by moby/moby (71,560+ GitHub stars). It gives an agent a more technical and reliable way to work with the tool than a thin one-line wrapper, using stable interfaces like Docker Engine API, Dockerfiles, docker compose, image builds, registries and preserving the operational context that matters for real tasks. In practice, the skill gives an agent a stable interface to docker so it can inspect state, run the right operation, and produce a result that fits into a larger engineering or operations pipeline. The implementation typically relies on Docker Engine API, Dockerfiles, docker compose, image builds, registries, with configuration passed through environment variables, connection strings, service tokens, or workspace config depending on the upstream platform.

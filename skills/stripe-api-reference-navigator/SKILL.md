The Stripe API Reference Navigator provides intelligent traversal of the entire Stripe REST API surface. Built around the stripe-node SDK, it resolves complex payment flows including PaymentIntent confirmation sequences, SetupIntent lifecycle management, and Subscription billing anchor calculations. The skill understands Connect platform semantics—application fees, destination charges, and separate charges with transfers—and can generate correct API call sequences for multi-party payment scenarios. It parses webhook event payloads against the official Stripe OpenAPI spec, validating that your endpoint handlers cover all required fields. Supports idempotency key strategies, API versioning headers, and automatic pagination through list endpoints using auto-paging iterators. Includes built-in knowledge of rate limit tiers and retry-after semantics for production-grade integrations.

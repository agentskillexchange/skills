# Terraform Plan Diff Analyzer

This skill analyzes Terraform plan output to provide human-readable summaries and policy checks before applying infrastructure changes. It parses the JSON output from terraform show -json or retrieves plan artifacts from the Terraform Cloud API using the /api/v2/plans/{id}/json-output endpoint. The skill categorizes resources by action type (create, update, delete, replace) and highlights destructive changes with red-flag annotations. It integrates with Open Policy Agent (OPA) by submitting the plan JSON to a configured OPA policy server or running rego policies locally via the opa eval command. Policy violations block the pipeline and generate detailed reports. The skill supports Terraform workspaces, remote backends, and module-level change summaries. Output formats include Markdown, JSON, and GitHub Pull Request comments via the GitHub Checks API.

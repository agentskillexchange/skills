# CircleCI Orb Pipeline Agent

The CircleCI Orb Pipeline Agent creates and optimizes CircleCI pipelines using config.yml v2.1 syntax, the CircleCI API v2 (circleci.com/api/v2/project, /pipeline, /workflow), and reusable Orbs from the CircleCI Orb Registry. It generates efficient pipeline configurations with proper resource allocation.

The agent leverages CircleCI Orbs for common tasks including circleci/node, circleci/python, circleci/docker, circleci/aws-cli, and circleci/kubernetes. It configures orb commands, jobs, and executors with version pinning and vulnerability scanning through orb source inspection.

Test splitting is optimized via circleci tests split –split-by=timings with historical timing data to balance parallel containers. The agent configures resource_class selection (small, medium, large, xlarge) based on job requirements and cost analysis via the API.

Dynamic configuration through setup workflows enables monorepo path filtering, conditional job execution, and generated config patterns. The agent manages pipeline parameters, contexts for secret management, and scheduled pipeline triggers. Performance optimization includes Docker layer caching, workspace persistence across jobs, and test result aggregation for flaky test detection.

## Installation

Choose the setup that fits your environment:

1. **OpenClaw skill installer**
   - Add this skill through your OpenClaw skills workflow if you use managed installs.
2. **Git clone**
   - Clone the upstream project or skill repo, then follow its setup instructions.
3. **Package manager**
   - Install with the ecosystem package manager when the upstream project publishes one.
4. **Manual copy**
   - Copy the skill folder into your local skills directory and reload your agent.
5. **Container or CI environment**
   - Bake the dependency into your image or automation environment before running the skill.

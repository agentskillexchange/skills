# ArgoCD GitOps Sync Manager

The ArgoCD GitOps Sync Manager provides intelligent synchronization control for Kubernetes GitOps workflows. It interfaces with the ArgoCD Application Controller via the gRPC API for real-time sync status monitoring and automated drift remediation.

The agent implements sophisticated sync strategies including selective resource synchronization using sync waves and hooks, automated rollback triggered by Prometheus health checks via the ArgoCD Resource Hook framework, and progressive delivery integration with Argo Rollouts for canary and blue-green deployment patterns.

Advanced capabilities include ApplicationSet template generation using the Git Generator, Pull Request Generator, and Matrix Generator for dynamic multi-cluster application provisioning. The agent configures sync policies with automated pruning, self-healing, and retry backoff strategies. It also manages ArgoCD RBAC policies via the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap and integrates with External Secrets Operator for GitOps-compatible secret management across namespaces.

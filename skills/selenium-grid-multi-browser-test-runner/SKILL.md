# Selenium Grid Multi-Browser Test Runner

This skill manages parallel cross-browser test execution using Selenium Grid 4 with the WebDriver protocol. It connects to a Selenium Hub via webdriver.Remote() with configurable hub URL and DesiredCapabilities for each target browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). The skill constructs a browser matrix from configuration, spawning concurrent sessions using asyncio.gather() for Python or Promise.all() for Node.js implementations. Each session uses the standard WebDriver API: driver.get() for navigation, driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR) for element location, element.click() and element.send_keys() for interaction. It implements the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable test organization. Screenshots on failure use driver.save_screenshot() with timestamped filenames. The skill handles session lifecycle management including implicit/explicit waits via WebDriverWait with expected_conditions, and proper cleanup with driver.quit() in finally blocks. Test results aggregate across all browser nodes into a unified HTML report using the Allure framework integration. Supports custom Chrome options via ChromeOptions.add_argument() for headless mode, proxy settings, and window sizing.

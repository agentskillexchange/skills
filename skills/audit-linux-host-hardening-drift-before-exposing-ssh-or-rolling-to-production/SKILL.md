# Audit Linux host hardening drift before exposing SSH or rolling to production

Uses Lynis to run an on-host security audit and turn the findings into a prioritized hardening checklist for an agent or operator. Invoke it when a machine is about to become internet-facing, after base image changes, or whenever you need a quick read on hardening drift instead of a generic vulnerability scan.

Overview
The GitHub Actions Matrix Orchestrator dynamically generates CI/CD matrix strategies for complex multi-platform builds. By leveraging the GitHub REST API’s workflow dispatch endpoint and the actions/github-script action, it creates conditional job matrices that adapt based on changed files, branch names, or PR labels.
Key Capabilities
This skill handles OIDC token federation for cross-account AWS deployments, enabling secure assume-role operations without storing long-lived credentials. It analyzes dorny/paths-filter outputs to determine which matrix combinations are necessary, reducing unnecessary CI minutes. The orchestrator supports reusable workflow composition with workflow_call triggers and dynamic job generation through JSON matrix output steps.
Technical Integration
Integrates with GitHub’s check runs API for granular status reporting, supports concurrency groups for deployment serialization, and manages artifact retention policies through the actions/upload-artifact v4 API. Compatible with self-hosted runners using custom labels and runner groups.

# SonarQube Rule Enforcement Agent

The SonarQube Rule Enforcement Agent connects directly to the SonarQube Web API to monitor code quality metrics across your entire codebase. It uses the sonar-scanner CLI to run incremental analysis on every pull request, evaluating complexity, duplication, maintainability, reliability, and security ratings against customizable quality gates. When issues are detected, the agent annotates the PR with inline comments pointing to exact file locations and suggests fixes based on SonarQube rule descriptions. It tracks quality trends over time using the measures/search endpoint, generating weekly reports on technical debt evolution. The agent supports multi-language projects with language-specific rule profiles and can automatically create Jira tickets for critical issues that need immediate attention. Configuration is managed through a YAML file that maps SonarQube quality profiles to repository branches and deployment environments.
